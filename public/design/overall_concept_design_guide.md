---
![Game Art](/images/new_tarro.webp)
## 1. VISUAL OVERVIEW OF THE GAME

### 1.1 Tone & Genre

Dark fantasy with semi-realistic Elden Ring–inspired art direction

**Key Characteristics:**
- Rugged, woodsy, cold, oppressive
- Magic is scarce, unstable, and dangerous
- The ancient Beanstalk Stump dominates the world geographically and spiritually
- Magicborn are feared, used, and controlled
- The world is bleak, but magic glows in pockets—embers, runes, spores, blue fire, ash

### 1.2 Core Visual Identity

**Rendering Style:**
- Painterly, high-detail rendering
- Firelight as the main magical lighting
- Deep shadows, damp forests, moss, bark textures

**Color Palette:**
- Glow colors for magic: ember-orange, fungal-green, faint icy-blue

**Design Elements:**
- Clothing is worn, utilitarian; armor is improvised or militarized
- Architecture: medieval stone mixed with wooden fortifications, rootlike bridges, and vine-grown structures

## 2. THE WORLD AT A GLANCE

### 2.1 Kingdom of Tarro

The major human city-state built around the colossal stump of the ancient Beanstalk.

**Characteristics:**
- Militaristic, stone-and-timber architecture
- Magicborn labor force is controlled through rune brands
- City lights glow in warm amber; heavily guarded gates; looming towers

### 2.2 The Beanstalk Stump

A titanic, world-defining structure.

**Features:**
- Its roots create caves, hollows, hidden tunnels
- Residual mana seeps into nearby landscapes
- The land becomes twisted or cursed from past magical catastrophes

### 2.3 The Wildlands

**Environment:**
- Twisted forests, cursed bogs, abandoned settlements
- Ancient ruins scarred by Magicborn rebellions
- Faint glowing remnants of old spells anchored in the earth

### 2.4 Mana Ecology

Magic is limited and tied to places:

- Tarro's inner sanctum slowly regenerates Magicborn mana
- Cursed zones warp mana into hostile forms
- Runestones, relics, and old spell ruins are sources of risk and power

## 3. NARRATIVE THEMES FOR VISUALS

### 3.1 Servitude & Survival

Magicborn are branded and used by Tarro:

- Guards escort chained magicborn
- Soldiers forcing spellcraft labor
- Campfire scenes where magicborn re-learn or try to expand their ability

### 3.2 Breaking Free or Falling Apart

Your protagonist is:

- Underpowered
- Underfed
- Untrained
- Unvalued

But with potential.

**Visual moments reflect:**
- Hard choices
- Outlaw life
- Dangerous experimentation
- Cursed lands and ancient mistakes

### 3.3 The Scars of Magic

Magicborn historically caused:

- Forests petrified mid-burn
- Towns frozen in a moment
- Giant beasts twisted into horrors

These curses remain active visually—excellent for atmospheric teasers.

## 4. CORE GAMEPLAY VISUAL SETUPS (IMAGE SCENES)

These are scenes we want to create now for teasers and image-to-video transitions.

### Scene Set A — Spellcrafting & Campfire Rituals

The signature mechanic.

#### A1 — First Spell-Campfire

A Magicborn kneels over a fire, drawing runes in ember light. The flames morph in response—turning blue, spiraling upward, or forming shapes.

#### A2 — Attempting a New Rune

A disastrous miscast:

- Sparks exploding
- Runes breaking apart
- The character thrown back
- Fire turning into ash clouds or crimson light

#### A3 — Group Spellcrafting

Multiple Magicborn chained together, forced by Tarro soldiers to ignite a massive fire for construction or war rituals.

### Scene Set B — Character Portrait / 3D Mesh Ref Sheets

For reusable 3D character asset generation.

#### B1 — Wood-Leather Scout Magicborn

- Thin, agile, quiet
- Worn leather, bark plating, glowing vine wraps

#### B2 — Dark Iron Enforcer

- Heavy armor, runebound shackles
- Charcoal-black plates with glowing red restraints

#### B3 — Outlaw Magicborn

- Improvised armor
- Healed scars from mana overuse
- Runes etched into their own skin

#### B4 — Female Magicborn Wanderer

- Cloak, travel gear, bound spellbook
- Mana-starved, determined expression

### Scene Set C — Tarro City Life

To show oppression and culture.

#### C1 — Magicborn in Chains Being Marched into the City

Soldiers escorting shackled magicborn along a wooden bridge toward Tarro's main gate.

#### C2 — Marketplace with Magic Items

Civilians trading minor magic artifacts:

- Glowing cups
- Vine lamps
- Simple healing stones

But magicborn aren't allowed to touch them freely.

#### C3 — Spell-Barracks

Young Magicborn trained under harsh conditions.

### Scene Set D — Cursed Lands

Showing the results of historical magical catastrophes.

#### D1 — Forest Frozen Mid-Burn

Flames suspended in crystal-like stillness, never progressing.

#### D2 — Hollow Creatures

Wolves with bark-growing through them, animated by old spells.

#### D3 — The Sundered Village

Objects floating in air, stuck by ancient gravitational magic.

### Scene Set E — Story Moments

For trailers and emotional connection.

#### E1 — Protagonist's Rune Branding

A close-up of a glowing restraint-rune being pressed onto their skin.

#### E2 — First Outlaw Night

Hiding from Tarro scouts under broken roots.

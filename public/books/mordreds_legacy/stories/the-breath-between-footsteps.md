SHORT STORY — “The Breath Between Footsteps”
(Act I: The Leaving)
[Watch the scene](./the-breath-between-footsteps.mp4)
Kael didn’t expect the world outside Tarro to feel so empty.

One moment he had walls towering behind him—strict, warm-lit battlements humming with mageglass lamps—and the next, nothing but open wilderness and cold that seemed to sharpen the further he walked.

The stories never mentioned the emptiness.

They only whispered of the Rune Path.
Not a road, not a trail—just a pattern of choices.
A way out.
A way forward.
Passed between Magicborn in quiet fragments:
Head north until the air tastes metallic.
Walk until the trees stop growing straight.
Follow the cold, not the light.

Myth disguised as direction.
Direction disguised as hope.

Kael followed it anyway.

But now the sun was gone, and the cold was taking whatever courage he had left. His breath fogged and froze almost instantly. His fingers felt wooden. Even his heartbeat seemed to drag.

He needed fire.
Not for comfort—
but to keep his blood from stalling in his veins.

(Act II: The Trying)

He found a shallow between two frost-bitten shrubs, wind-shielded enough to try. Kneeling sent pain through his legs, but stopping was no longer a choice. His hands shook so badly he had to steady them against the ground.

Magicborn weren’t meant to use magic this freely. In Tarro, speaking a rune-syllable outside sanctioned places meant confinement—or worse. Words carried weight. Even the smallest sound could alter the air, spark a reaction, change something unintended.

That fear had always kept Kael quiet.

But fear wouldn’t keep him alive tonight.

He breathed once, slow and cold.

The first attempt was nothing—only steam trembling from his lips.

The second attempt held a hint of resonance, a faint vibration in his chest before melting into the wind.

He forced his breath deeper, even though the cold clawed at his lungs. The syllable—soft, nearly silent—escaped as a fragile sound no louder than a whisper swallowed by snow.

An ember-like curve of light drifted from his mouth.
Wavering.
Weak.

It flickered downward and caught in the hollow he’d made.

For a moment, the world held its breath with him.

Then a tiny flame sparked—faint, shivering, no bigger than a candle stub.

Kael nearly sagged in relief, but the cold punished hesitation. He leaned close, guarding the flame with his body, shaping another quiet breath. He tried the next syllable softly enough not to risk losing control of it.

The rune-letter formed, but dissolved halfway to the fire.

Kael’s head dropped. His breath shook with exhaustion. His eyes stung from the cold. The flame wavered dangerously, almost guttering out.

He pressed his palms around it, not to shape magic, but just to shield what little warmth he’d created.

(Act III: The Choosing)

The flame steadied. Barely.

It was not enough for comfort. Not enough for safety.
But it was enough to live one more hour.

Kael curled tighter around it, letting the glow touch his face. His breath slowed to shallow, deliberate pulls. His fingers burned painfully as feeling returned.

Above him stretched a sky bleached of stars, a blank sheet of night. There was no guidance. No signs. No markers.

The Rune Path offered no map.
Just faith that if Magicborn kept leaving, kept trying, kept choosing freedom over fear—someone, somewhere, would reach the end of the myth.

Kael let the fragile fire warm his hands.
He wasn’t certain of tomorrow.
He wasn’t certain of himself.

But he whispered—not aloud, not truly voiced, only breathed so the warmth alone might hear:

I’m still alive.

The flame answered with the smallest flare.

In all the emptiness beyond Tarro, that was enough to keep him moving.

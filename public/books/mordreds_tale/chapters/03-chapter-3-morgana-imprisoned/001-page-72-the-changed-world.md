# Page 72 - The Changed World

The palisade gates opened to reveal a settlement transformed.
Morgana stepped through, the child pressed against her chest, and stopped. This was not the small huts the slaves used to live in, she. Stone buildings rose three stories high along paved streets. A fountain stood in the central square, water flowing freely—an impossible luxury in a world without magic, yet there it was. Scaffolding marked new construction everywhere she looked. Merchants called out their wares. Children ran laughing between the buildings.


This was prosperity. Order. A city being born.


"This way," the taller guard said, gesturing toward a large hall dominating the square


She watched the guards as they passed through the streets. One wore a bracelet she recognized—transformation magic, Vexara's work. Another had a ring marked with Maliphant's sigil. Items that should have been dead, dormant. But they weren't. They held something. A charge, faint but present.


The Council Hall's doors stood open. Inside, seven figures sat at a curved table. Morgana recognized one: Marcus, the record keeper, now grey and weathered. A rough-looking man spoke first, his voice blunt.


"Name?"


"…"

Morgana looked directly at the man and made it obvious to that she wouldn’t respond to him through a . 


Marcus's eyes widened. "Morgana. You were part of the Pantheon's court."


"I was, its good to see a familiar face."


”So you’ll talk now..ah?," the rough man said, studying her. "Where have you been all this time?"



“...”



Silence to what the man said only looking at Marcus.



Marcus looks at the man and then at Morgana, “Where…have…you been all this time?”


"I went to sleep in my chamber. When I woke, everything had changed.  But I made my way out, but encountered much change within the home i once knew, and now i am here before you."



“Tell me what has happened”

"I believe I may have come off a bit disrespectful.  I'm Derrick," the rough man said. 



Morgana looks at him listening



"The Pantheon's stopped moving one day.  In fact, the gods that ruled for the entirety of human existence…became mortal, unmoving, and did not survive at the hands of the slaves that they had kept personally in a single day. 



Creatures spilled out of the place you call home.  And all of the weapons, tools, and things we relied on were mere chunks of metal or just a sharp blade.  Fortunately most of us were able to survive, but fending of those beasts was difficult.



We rebuilt what we could with the survivors, distant kingdoms even sent emissaries to check on the gods, and wanted to know why their city no longer functioned like it did before.  Magic…a resource that we didn’t know how pervasive in our lives it actually was.  Disappeared. 

”  



“I’ve spun the tale of how The Fall happened, now tell me something.  That yours?



He gestured at the child.


"Yes."



“Father?”


”…” 


Derrick grunted. "You need shelter?"


"I do."


"We'll set you up in the eastern district. Rooms, food, whatever." He leaned forward slightly. "You knew the Pantheon. We got questions about what happened. You help us with that, we help you."


"Take her to the eastern quarters. Get her settled."


The guards led her back into the streets. As they walked, Morgana studied everything—the new buildings, the fountain, the people moving with purpose and confidence. Someone had vision. Power. The resources to make both reality.


They reached a stone building with simple but clean rooms. A bed, table, hearth. A cradle by the window.


"Food's coming. We're outside if you need anything."


When they left, Morgana sat with the child. He was warm against her chest, and while he touched her, she felt whole. Strong. When she set him in the cradle, that strength faded—not gone, but diminished. Mortal.
She needed to understand this connection. Needed to understand what had happened to her during those lost years.
But first, she needed to learn about this new world. This city being built. And whoever ruled it with enough power to make dead magic live again.

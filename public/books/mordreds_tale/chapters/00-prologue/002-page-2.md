The brave guard—Roran—hesitated a moment before pushing the Overseer. His breath hitched as he laid his hands on the figure's shoulder, the once-mighty god now a hollow shell. He shoved again, harder this time. The Overseer tumbled forward, its limbs rigid, clattering to the ground like a broken statue.

A hush fell over the field as it hit the earth with a metallic thud. The sound echoed into the distance, but no one moved. The Overseer's eyes—those once-glowing orbs that had commanded fear and obedience in equal measure—were now dull, the familiar golden hue drained from them.

“By the gods...” Sara whispered, her voice barely audible. “He... he’s dead.”

Morgause felt the tremor in her chest as she glanced at her fellow workers. The tension was palpable, each of them caught in a shared, unspoken question: What now?

Roran stepped back, eyes wide with confusion. “I didn’t... I didn’t think he could...” His voice trailed off, unsteady, as if the very reality of the situation was still sinking in.

The air around them, which had once been thick with the hum of magic, now felt wrong—stagnant, hollow. It was as though the world itself had exhaled a final breath.

“That can’t be…” Morgause murmured, stepping closer. She bent down, reaching out to touch the Overseer’s arm. The cold metal of its skin sent a shiver up her spine. How had he gotten so… still? She’d never seen anything like it before—no god, no machine, no being that had been this lifeless.

Somewhere behind her, one of the harvesters gasped.

“The crops!” someone shouted. “The crops are stopping!”

Ansel, standing near the machine with his shimmering crystal in hand, cursed under his breath. "This isn’t right. This isn’t how it’s supposed to be. These tools—they don’t work anymore!”

The harvesters clustered together, their hands running over the enchanted tools they had been given—scepters, amulets, and rings imbued with magic to hasten the crops’ harvest. None of them sparked to life. The familiar hum of power was absent.

One by one, they tested their items, their faces filled with dread as they flickered and dimmed, as though the very magic that had seemed to be a natural thing, a natural resource, was no longer there.

“What’s happening?” Ansel asked, voice tight. “Why won’t they work?” His hand trembled as he held his glowing amulet aloft, watching it flicker before it died completely, leaving only a dull, lifeless stone in his palm.

“I don’t know,” Morgause said, her own magical storage item, a “pocket”, which had all the food she had been collecting all day and night, seemed to not work, give nothing back, and accept nothing. “But we need answers. All of us.”

She glanced over her shoulder to see Roran still standing frozen, staring down at the Overseer’s body. There was no panic in his stance, only confusion. Morgause’s stomach tightened. Roran had always been one of the more disciplined of the guards, but even he seemed lost without the Overseer’s guiding influence.

“Get a grip!” shouted one of the older harvesters, a grizzled man named Thoren. “Get to the huts, now! Before it’s too late!”

Just as the first of the harvesters began to break into a panicked run, a sharp, ear-piercing cry rent the air. The animals.

Morgause looked toward the entrance of the “gods” lair, only to see that others were escaping and being chased by shadowy figures.  She turns to look at the low huts that lay just beyond the fields—sparse, identical homes where they all lived, separated only by the thin walls. The fields were their labor; the huts, their prison. But the huts were also their last hope of survival now.

Morgause’s heart dropped. She turned toward the trees at the edge of the field, her blood running cold. She could see more slaves and creatures in the distance. As more creatures emerged, their movements jerky and unnatural, their eyes glinting with an unholy flickering light. The dogs, twisted monstrosities—were the first to appear, but soon there were others.  Chasing after slaves that also came from the lair she had seen.   She couldn’t make out what they looked like, but they almost seemed human.  She didn’t care as much as she needed to run away.



As the creatures began to mow down the slaves as they left, the gaurds went to go fight them with their spears.



The first creature…



It was a dog—massive and feral, with eyes flickering periodically like molten amber. Its claws dug into the ground, and with a horrifying snarl, it tore into the nearest guard. Blood sprayed across the field. The man crumpled beneath it, his mouth opening in a final scream that was cut off as his throat was torn out.



Roran yells “run, get out of here”.



Morgause’s heart lurched, but there was no time for fear. There was only the cold, unflinching need to survive.



The slaves scattered.

“Morgause! Come on!” Sara’s voice broke through the roar of panic. Morgause turned to see her friend already sprinting toward the huts. Without thinking, she ran after her, pushing herself faster than she ever thought possible. luckily she was not too far along in her pregnancy that she was hindered too much.



Behind her, the creatures howled and tore through the fields, their hunger undeterred by anything human. Morgause’s chest burned with each breath, but she didn’t dare stop to look back. She had to make it to safety, had to survive this madness.

As they reached the row of huts, Morgause didn’t pause, not even to glance back at the fields. But as they rounded the corner to the first hut, she caught a flash of movement in her peripheral vision—a shadow darting between the trees.

“Did you see that?” she whispered, more to herself than Sara. But the answer was already in the air, thick with dread.

There were others.

Not just the beasts—something worse. Something that didn’t belong in this world. Magic was dying, and in its wake, monsters.

They reached the small cluster of huts. Without a word, they darted into the nearest shelter, breathing hard. The door creaked shut behind them with a thud, sealing them inside.

For a long moment, no one spoke. The sound of the creatures outside was muffled by the thin walls, but Morgause could still hear the screams. The confusion.

“We can’t stay here,” Sara said finally, her voice shaking. “Not for long.”

Morgause nodded grimly. “We’re going to have to find out what’s happening. Before it’s too late.”

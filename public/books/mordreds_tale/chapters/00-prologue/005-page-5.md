Morgause's shoulders ached as she worked the field with her basket, gathering crops the old-fashioned way. A week of manual labor had already begun forming calluses on her hands, so different from the magical harvesting she'd known all her life. She paused, straightening carefully to accommodate her swollen belly, when she heard the approaching hoofbeats.

Through the swaying stalks of corn, she glimpsed the royal procession making its way down the newly-cleared road. Thirty riders, their purple and silver livery marking them as Silvercrest nobility, though the fabric had lost its usual magical shimmer. The lead riders' ceremonial robes, traditionally imbued with powers to repel dust and wrinkles, now showed the wear of hard travel.

"Morgause!" Sara called from the next row over. "Look at their rings - all dead, just like the ones from The Pantheon's vault."

Indeed, the messengers' hands glittered with powerless jewelry, once-magnificent artifacts now reduced to mere metal and stone. Their guards' armor, previously enhanced by The Pantheon's magic, showed patches of rust and tarnish. Even their banner, which should have been floating gracefully regardless of wind, hung limp from its pole.

The lead messenger, a woman with steel-gray hair and perfect posture, drew her mount to a halt near the field's edge. Her voice carried across the rows of corn, practiced and commanding despite its underlying tension. "I am Lady Castellan Meridith, Royal Messenger of Silvercrest. We seek audience with whoever now commands this place."

Roran stepped forward from his post at the watchtower, a dwarf named Gruff at his side. The sight made Lady Meridith's eyes widen - she clearly hadn't expected to see one of The Pantheon's experimental subjects standing as an equal among the guards.

"Seven days ago," Lady Meridith continued, her composure cracking slightly, "every magical artifact in our kingdom failed. Our floating gardens fell. Our eternal flames died. Even our simplest enchanted tools ceased functioning." She held up her hand, rings glinting dully in the sunlight. "These artifacts, passed down through generations, all came from The Pantheon's lair. We demand to know what has happened here."

Morgause watched as more workers gathered at the field's edge, drawn by the commotion. She saw the fear in the visitors' eyes as they took in the barricades, the mixed groups of humans, dwarfs, and goblins working together, and the looming structure of The Pantheon's lair in the distance.

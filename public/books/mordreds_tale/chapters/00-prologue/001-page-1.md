Morgause wiped sweat from her brow as she worked the endless rows of The Fields, her swollen belly making each movement more difficult than the last. The great machine that fed their world churned behind her, its familiar rhythm as constant as her own heartbeat. Steam hissed from its brass vents, while golden water poured endlessly from the floating vase above, feeding the crops that grew impossibly fast beneath her fingers. Like all harvesters, she had grown skilled at gathering the endless bounty, her hands moving with practiced efficiency.

She had just finished harvesting a row of corn that hadn't existed an hour ago when she noticed something wrong. The steam's steady pulse faltered. Then again. The endless cascade of water seemed to slow, droplets hanging in the air longer than they should.

Around her, other slaves paused in their work, heads lifting like prey animals sensing a storm. The guard stationed at the edge of her section gripped his spear tighter, eyes darting toward the machine. She had been with him before, as she had been with many others, all under the Pantheon's calculated breeding program. The identity of her child's father mattered little – it was simply another life created at the gods' command.

But it was the Overseer that drew Morgause's attention. The god-thing stood perfectly still, more statue than being, its usually fluid movements frozen mid-gesture. She had never seen one of the Pantheon appear so... mortal. Its eyes, normally gleaming with immortal light, had dulled to a mundane brown.

The corn stalk beneath her fingers, which should have been growing inches with each passing second, barely stretched toward the sky. Something fundamental had changed in the world, though Morgause couldn't say what. She only knew that the magic that had ruled her life – ruled all their lives – felt suddenly, inexplicably... different.

"What's happening?" Morgause called out to Sara, a fellow harvester working the next row. Their metal chokers gleamed in the sunlight, but neither feared speaking – the Overseer had always permitted conversation, claiming it gave him valuable insights into his charges.

"I don't know," Sara whispered back, one hand unconsciously touching her choker. "But look – he's not moving. He always moves."

The whispers grew louder, turning into a confused murmur as more harvesters gathered, forgetting their stations. Even the guards, their own chokers marking them as merely a different class of slave, joined the growing crowd. Their spears lowered, the usual barriers between guard and harvester momentarily forgotten in their shared bewilderment.

"The Overseer," someone said. "Look at the Overseer!"

A brave soul – one of the younger guards – approached the motionless figure. Everyone tensed, expecting the familiar crackle of punishment through their chokers, but nothing came. The guard waved a hand before its dulled eyes, something that would have meant instant pain mere moments ago. The Overseer didn't react. Its skin had taken on an almost grayish tinge, its formerly pristine appearance now somehow diminished.

"Is he... dead?" The question hung in the air, heavy with implications none of them dared to fully consider.

More questions followed, a lifetime of cautious speech turning into open discussion. Guards and harvesters alike shared uncertain glances, their usual roles forgotten in this moment of unprecedented change. They were all bound by the same chokers, all subject to the same god's will – a god who now stood as lifeless as the slowing crops around them.

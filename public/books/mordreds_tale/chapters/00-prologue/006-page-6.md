Marcus stepped forward from among the workers, his once-pristine record keeper's robes now stained with soil from the fields. Thoren emerged beside him, and Lady Meridith's guards shifted uneasily at the sight of their former administrators standing among the field workers.

"You were last here before the fall," Marcus said quietly. "The Pantheon's chambers still hummed with power then. You demanded more enchanted rings for your kingdom's nobles."

One of Lady Meridith's guards spat on the ground. "And you were nothing but a record keeper, servant. Know your place."

Thoren's eyes fixed on the guard's tarnished breastplate - armor he himself had logged in the Pantheon's inventory. "That plate mail you wear - I remember recording its enchantments myself. How well does it protect you now that the magic has failed?"

Lady Meridith's mount stamped nervously as people began gathering at the edges of the fields. Workers set down their tools, their faces streaked with honest dirt. A handful of dwarves emerged from their posts near the barricade, Gruff among them. Two goblins peered out from behind the newly constructed grain storage, their eyes sharp and wary.

"You forget yourselves," Lady Meridith said, her composure cracking further. "The Pantheon appointed you to serve, to keep records, to manage their lesser affairs. You were never meant to-"

"The Pantheon is gone," Marcus stated simply. "Their magic died with them. We who survived had to find a new way forward. Together."

The tension grew thicker as more guards shifted in their saddles, clearly uncomfortable with the growing crowd. Their eyes darted between the dwarves' sturdy frames and the gathering field workers, aware they were now badly outnumbered.

Morgause watched as Lady Meridith's carefully maintained dignity began to fray at the edges.

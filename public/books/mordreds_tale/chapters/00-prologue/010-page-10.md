The ancient steps descended into darkness, their surface marred by dried blood that had turned a deep rust color. Lady Meredith Caldifer and her guards followed Gruff (The dwarf) past the makeshift barricades - a hodgepodge of wooden beams, broken furniture, and salvaged metal that groaned as they worked to clear a path.

"When The Pantheon fell, we were attacked by creatures coming out of their underground lair," Gruff explained, his hands trembling slightly as he worked the gate. "We placed these barricades to keep them out. Haven't seen anything emerge since those first terrible days, but best to be careful."

The entrance before them gaped like a wound - broken steps that once seamlessly merged with the earth by divine will now showed obvious seams and cracks. Dark stains marked where twisted creatures had fallen, their inhuman blood eating small craters into the stone. The walls bore deep gouges where something - or many somethings - had clawed their way up during the escape.

Lady Meredith stood at the threshold, her normally imperious demeanor shaken by the evidence before her. Her mind raced with implications: why would blood be here, why would they have a barricade, why is magic gone?

"I refuse to go any further," she declared, her voice sharp with barely contained panic. "I believe you now. We don't have enough men here to handle what might be down there. I refuse to die due to mere curiosity when there are more important matters at hand."

"But we haven't even gone inside yet," Gruff protested. "We aren't sure what lies beneath since the collapse."

"We will return to your settlement and establish proper protocols," she cut him off, falling back on bureaucratic language like a shield. "This requires organization, structure, proper documentation. We'll need more than just men - we'll need equipment, torches, rope... and a way to contain anything we might find still alive down there."

"Aye," Gruff agreed, relief flickering in his eyes despite his frustration. "And healers too. If any of the... experiments... survived, they might need help. That is, if they can be helped at all." The words tasted bitter in his mouth as he remembered his own transformation.

Lady Meredith's eyes studied his dwarven features with new understanding. For the first time, she seemed to truly see him not as just another transformed creature, but as someone who had survived unimaginable horrors. Her posture softened almost imperceptibly. "Yes," she said quietly. "Healers would be... prudent."

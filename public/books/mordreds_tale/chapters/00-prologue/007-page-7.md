Lady Meredith could visibly be seen getting impatient, frustrated. She lets out a yell at Marcus.

"Show us they are dead, I doubt that you all could have killed the unkillable, and magic being gone is unlikely".

"Impossible!" Lady Meridith's voice cracked like a whip. "You will take us to the Pantheon chambers immediately. I demand an audience!"

 "The Pantheon created kingdoms, forged alliances that lasted centuries! They cannot simply vanish like common mortals!"

Marcus stepped forward, his memories of their power making his voice bitter. "Yet they have not come for us,  all their grand designs...are gone, or completed" He gestured to the simple fields around them, "This is what remains. We who survive must learn to live without their magic, without their protection, without the cruelty."

Lady Meridith's horse pranced nervously as she yanked the reins. "This is nonsense. “

The lady pulling on her horse more tightly, the guards gripping their swords firmly, as they have begun to learn what has possibly happened.

Lady Meridith's final shred of composure shattered. "You'll regret these lies! When the Pantheon returns-"

"They won't return," Marcus cut her off, his voice carrying the weight of bitter experience. "The sooner you accept that truth, the sooner you can begin to rebuild, as we have."

The lady and her guards retreated under the steady gaze of the community, their threats echoing hollowly across the fields they once ruled. Their frustration was a tangible thing, crackling in the air like the ghost of the magic that had abandoned them all.

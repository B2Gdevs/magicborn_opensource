As the sun dipped low on the horizon, Morgause stood at the edge of the field, her gaze following the flicker of torchlight as Lady Meridith and her entourage returned. The nobles looked weary, their shoulders heavy with an unspoken resignation. Even from a distance, Morgause could sense the mix of relief and sadness that settled over the village. The Pantheon, once seen as both protectors and oppressors, had left a void that none could ignore.

Morgause’s hands rested on the swell of her belly, feeling the faint flutter of life within. She knew her child would be born into a world reshaped by uncertainty. As the nobles approached, Morgause stepped forward, meeting Lady Meridith’s eyes with a calm that spoke of both an ending and a beginning.

“We found nothing but emptiness,” Lady Meridith admitted, dismounting. “The Pantheon is truly gone. We must learn to protect ourselves now.”

Morgause nodded. “We will. We’ll shape this world together, without their shadow.” She glanced at the villagers gathering around, feeling the weight of her own role in this fragile new beginning. Soon, her child would arrive, a symbol of a future they would build from the ruins of the past.

And with that, the village prepared for the next chapter—one that would lead them away from the legacy of the Pantheon and into a future where they, not the gods, would decide their fate.

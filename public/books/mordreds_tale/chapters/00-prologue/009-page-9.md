Gruff's weathered hands trembled slightly as he continued his tale. "The chambers I speak of still hold many of their prisoners. I saw them myself - crude cells made of vines and wood, holding creatures I can barely describe. Not even half of what was contained in those first two floors managed to escape when the barriers broke."

"Some were like me - humans transformed into goblins and dwarves. Others..." he shuddered at the memory. "Others were things that should never have existed. When their power failed, some of the creatures broke free, but many remain trapped down there."

"We haven't had the resources to properly search the lair," Gruff explained, his voice growing urgent. "This past week, we've been focused on finding food, shelter, just trying to survive. But with your guards, my lady, and my knowledge of those first two levels..." He looked at Lady Meridith intently. "We could mount a proper expedition. There's so much we need to understand about what they did down there."

"I know every corridor, every chamber of those upper floors. I can guide your men safely through what I know. But we'll need numbers - enough guards to protect us while we search, while still maintaining security up here."

Lady Meridith considered Gruff's proposal carefully, her eyes narrowing. Though skepticism still burned within her, curiosity and a desire to prove them wrong won out. "Very well," she declared, her voice carrying the weight of authority. "We shall mount this expedition. I want to see these chambers for myself, to witness what remains of their supposed downfall. Captain, assemble a detail of your most capable guards. We'll need enough men to both protect our search party and maintain security at the surface."

Gruff's expression remained grave as he nodded in acknowledgment. He knew what horrors awaited them below, but at least now they would have the strength in numbers to properly investigate what remained imprisoned in those dark halls.

Though Morgause and Sara both agreed they should move...they couldn't figure out where to go. How to escape, or anything, ultimately they remained frozen in indecision as chaos erupted outside.

The sounds of battle grew closer - the clash of spears against monstrous flesh, the determined shouts of guards fighting to protect their fellow slaves. Through a crack in the hut's wooden walls, they could see flashes of movement: guards working in coordinated groups, their training evident even in this crisis.

"We should have run when we had the chance," Sara whispered, pressing herself against the far wall as something large crashed nearby.

Morgause placed a protective hand over her belly. "Maybe staying was the right choice. We're not fighters, Sara. And in my condition..."

A howl cut through the air, followed by the sound of splintering wood. They held their breath, hearts pounding. But then came new sounds - organized shouting, the rhythmic march of reinforcements.

Through gaps in the walls, they watched as the guards formed a defensive line, protecting the cluster of huts where many slaves had taken refuge. Their discipline held against the onslaught of twisted creatures, pushing them back step by bloody step.

Hours seemed to pass, though it might have been minutes. Finally, a sharp knock came at their door. "Clear! All survivors, sound off!"

Morgause and Sara exchanged glances before calling out. When the door opened, they found Roran there, bloodied but alive. "You two made the right choice," he said grimly. "The ones who ran... we couldn't save them all."

As they emerged from the hut, they saw the aftermath - guards tending to wounds, securing the perimeter, and gathering the surviving slaves into protected groups. The Fields lay in ruins, but they had held this small corner of their world.

Gruff stepped forward from among the dwarves, his weathered face showing the marks of someone who had seen the Pantheon's true nature firsthand. "If you doubt their demise, my lady," he called out, his voice carrying across the field, "then perhaps you'd care to inspect their chambers?"

A murmur rippled through the crowd. The guards shifted uncomfortably, aware of the rumors about those upper levels.

"I spent years there," Gruff continued, his eyes hard with memory. "I know every corner of the first 2 levels of the pantheons lair. Where they made me what I am. The magic that sustained their experiments - that powered their transformations, turning us humans in to goblins and dwarves - it's gone now. Like everything else."

Lady Meridith's face paled slightly. Even she knew the stories of the Pantheon's experimental subjects.

"The chambers still stand," Gruff said, gesturing toward the distant structure. "I'll gladly show you the empty vessels where they stored their power, the silent chambers where their experiments once screamed. Perhaps seeing their abandoned tools of transformation will convince you of their fate."

Marcus stepped closer to Gruff, nodding slowly. "The lady and her guards are welcome to witness what remains. Though I warn you - the sight of such abandoned power can be... unsettling."

The guards looked to Lady Meridith, their confidence wavering. The offer hung in the air, a challenge that would either confirm their worst fears or vindicate their beliefs. But the lady's proud posture had already begun to crack, her certainty fragmenting in the face of Gruff's grim invitation.

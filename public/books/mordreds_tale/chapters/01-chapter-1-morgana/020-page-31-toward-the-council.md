# Page 31 — Toward the Council

The guards did not lower their spears, but neither did they try to bar her way. Their eyes darted between one another, wordless agreement forming in their silence. At last, the taller one spoke, voice rough with unease.

“You can’t stay here. Not in the open. You’ll come with us — to the Council.”

Morgana studied him for a moment, then gave a short nod. She had no interest in parleying with frightened men. What she needed was shelter, food, and truth. Her chamber was gone. The lair was not what she remembered. And her child — her child needed safety more than anything. If the Council ruled this place now, then they would give her answers.

It wasn’t the crude barricade she might have imagined from the scattered rumors of mortal defenses. This was something else entirely. The lower edges were lined with the ghosts of wood—rotted stakes and splintered frames buried half in the soil, as though the remnants of an older, smaller structure had been swallowed by this new creation. Above them, a fortress wall soared: seamless stone cut in measured blocks, braced with iron and fitted so precisely it might have been carved from a single slab.

The craftsmanship was startling. It didn’t speak of panic or haste, but of order—discipline. Whoever built this hadn’t been trying to survive; they’d been claiming the land. The wind slid across its surface and broke without echo.

Morgana ignored their stares. Her thoughts circled inward. Merlin had not come when she called. No gods had stirred. The guards’ words gnawed at her: not since the magic stopped. How long had she slept? How much had changed?

The newborn stirred softly in her arms, pulling her focus back. She held him closer. Whatever waited beyond those walls, she would face it. But first — the Council.

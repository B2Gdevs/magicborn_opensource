# Page 23 — The Child’s Cry

The lycanthrope bent low, jaws yawning wide over the newborn. Strings of saliva dripped onto the swaddle, hissing faintly where they struck the cold stone. Its yellowed fangs gleamed, inches from the infant’s throat.

Morgana lunged — but she was too far. The child screamed.

It was no ordinary cry. Thin, terrified, sharp as glass — yet the air itself seemed to warp with it. The beast’s bite slowed, dragging through the space between them as though caught in tar. Its fangs hovered, suspended, a nightmare trapped mid-motion.

Morgana flung herself forward. She wrapped her arms around the infant, pulling him hard against her chest. The moment his mouth pressed into her skin, the sound muffled. Time snapped back.

The beast’s jaws clamped down — not on the child, but on Morgana’s back.

The crunch rang out like iron breaking on stone. Its fangs splintered, shards scattering across the dais in brittle fragments. The lycanthrope staggered back, dazed, jaws bloodied by its own broken teeth.

Morgana rose, towering now, power surging through her veins. The gash at her side sealed itself shut; blood dried as though erased. Holding the child, she was whole again.

The beast blinked, wary. Its predator’s cunning sharpened, no longer blinded by hunger. It began to circle her, steps deliberate, shoulders rolling. It tested her, searching for weakness.

It would not find any.

# Page 16 — The Gallery of Echoes

Morgana ascended the vine-slick stairs, her torch casting shadows up the carved wood that bent ever so slightly, as if curling away from the light. As the corridor opened, she stepped into a massive vaulted chamber — once known as the Gallery of Echoes.

In the age of the Pantheon, this space had been a marvel of acoustic and visual illusion. Voices could travel the length of the hall without ever being raised. The gods would perform speeches here — amplified, looped, layered by design — their words turning into divine chorus, their images reflected across mirrored walls that shimmered with enchantment.

Now, those mirrored surfaces lay shattered. Obsidian shards littered the mosaic floor in erratic constellations. Morgana stepped carefully between them, the newborn tight in her arms, the faint swish of cloth the only sound.

Her reflection — warped and fragmentary — glanced at her from a hundred angles. One shard showed her face as it was. Another stretched it slightly, catching only the edge of her profile. A third was black and absorbing — not magical, just broken, like a missing piece of something once whole. None of them changed. There was no magic left to make them do so.. Another made her monstrous. A third was simply empty, black and absorbing.

The ceiling overhead was once lacquered with constellations made from star-metal dust. She remembered watching them swirl at the will of whichever god held court. Now, they were dim and crumbling, the gold flaking off like skin from something long dead.

She passed the remains of an instrument — a chime wall — now bent and rusted. Once, these thin copper plates would ring harmonics when passed, tuning the soul of anyone walking by. She brushed it. Nothing. Silence.

Busts lined the corridor — broken now. She paused before one that still had a plaque intact: Xiradin, Echo-Sculptor of the Third Throne. Its jaw was missing. Something — clawed — had gouged three marks into the throat. Another bust farther down had melted into the wall, fused to the structure like wax.

The floor here had shifted. Roots — thick and pulsing — had begun to creep up from below, threading between the tiles and reaching toward the broken mirrors. One root split where a mirror shard had embedded in it. It bled sap that smelled faintly like cedar and something older — something sweet and rotting.

The child stirred slightly in her arms, but did not wake.

Morgana adjusted her hold, eyes scanning the walls. Movement flickered occasionally — never when she looked directly, only at the edge of vision. It was unclear whether it was a haunting or simply a trick of the fractured reflections.

Toward the far end of the gallery stood the largest mirror of them all. It had not shattered — it had bent. Warped like hot metal, the glass bubbled and curled inward, as if something had tried to come through it — or escape.

She passed it without touching. Even now, it whispered.

The air grew colder. Moisture gathered at the edges of her torch. Somewhere, far behind her, a chime rang — just one note — though no wind stirred.

She did not look back.

Ahead, the corridor narrowed into curling wood again, the lair guiding her upward, ever deeper into itself.

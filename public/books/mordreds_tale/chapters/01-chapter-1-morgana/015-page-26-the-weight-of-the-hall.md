# Page 26 — The Weight of the Hall

The Hall of Hollow Pilgrims stood vast and empty around her, its silence broken only by her own breathing. Morgana walked slowly, each step echoing along the stripped stone floors. She remembered this place as it had been: throngs of supplicants from conquered kingdoms kneeling in lines that stretched to the dais. Nobles of Cyrane, the proud generals of Andovar, the priests of Thestrel — all had come here to bend knee or be broken.

Now the hall was nothing but a carcass. The banners were gone, their cloth rotted into dust. The columns that once gleamed with polished veneer were cracked, leaning like tired sentinels. Faded scorch marks scarred the floor where executions had burned too hot.

The child stirred faintly against her chest. She pressed him closer, her mind turning again to the realization that gnawed at her: without him, she was only a shadow of herself. With him, she was more than immortal — unbreakable. The Pantheon had bound her, cursed her, and lied to her. The thought was a brand across her soul.

At the far end, the sealed gate loomed — pale wood bound in black iron, its hinges broad as shields. She had never seen it open in life, never even known it existed. Its presence now made her skin prickle.

It was no door of ceremony. It was a prison gate.

Morgana’s eyes opened to the quiet stillness of her chamber.

Faint torch light filled the room with a glow around her, soft and familiar. The black woven drapes, covering the vine-like wooding of the walls, had a slight tint of grey that she was unused to. Her bed was just as it always had been — layered with embroidered blankets, pillows fluffed, the scent of old incense lingering in the air. For a moment, everything seemed normal.

Then a strange ache curled through her body, low and tight. She blinked, adjusting to the light, trying to remember how late she’d fallen asleep. Had she eaten something strange? Her fingers went to her side — then stopped.

Her belly was swollen. Heavy. Her breath caught.

No.

She pushed herself upright with effort, hands trembling as they moved across the unfamiliar curve of her abdomen. It was unmistakable. She was… pregnant.

The realization hit her like cold water. She had never been able to conceive — that was the first thing she’d sacrificed for power. Immortality had stolen that future from her long ago.

And yet here she was.

Pain rippled through her again, sharper this time. She gasped, clutching the edge of the bed. It wasn’t just pregnancy. She was in labor.

“No,” she whispered, the word fragile and disbelieving. “This isn’t possible.”

Another wave came, more insistent. She reached out, grabbing a nearby table for balance, her mind racing. There had been no signs, no warnings. The night before, she’d simply gone to sleep.

Just sleep. Nothing strange. No dreams. No spells.

And now she was here — a child in her womb, her body preparing to bring it forth, and not a single memory to explain why.

Her hand trembled over her heart, over the pendant Merlin had once given her, no longer glowing as it used to.

She looked around, suddenly unsure if she was even in her own room at all.

But the stonework, the carved edge of the mirror, the small dish of dried herbs beside her bed — it was all familiar. It was her chamber. But the quiet was too deep, the warmth too faded.

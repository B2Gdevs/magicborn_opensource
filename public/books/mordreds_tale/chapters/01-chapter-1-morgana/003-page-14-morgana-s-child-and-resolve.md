# Page 14 - Morgana’s child and resolve

The chamber was still.

Hours may have passed. Time had blurred.

Morgana lay on her side now, her body aching, though less from pain and more from weight — the weight of what had changed. Beside her, nestled into the folds of embroidered bedding, the child slept. His chest rose in tiny, uneven patterns. His hands occasionally twitched.

Her eyes stayed on him.

“I know you’re mine…” she whispered, brushing a curl of black hair from his brow. “But who are you?”

She shifted onto her back, the ceiling above her carved with constellations that she used to look at to fall asleep. Her voice cracked as she continued, speaking only to herself — or perhaps to him.

“I could never have a child. That was the price. Immortality — for the sacrifice of legacy.”

She blinked back the heat in her eyes.

“I thought I gave you up for a kingdom.”

She sat up, slowly, careful not to wake him. The ache in her limbs was heavy, but not disabling. She felt… oddly intact. The blood had long dried on her skin and thighs, but she had bled far less than expected. No tearing. No fever. No complications. Only… a birth that had happened despite the impossible.

Her eyes returned to the boy.

“I can’t just lug you around…” she said softly, half-laughing at her own confusion. “Can I?”

She leaned close and pressed a kiss to his forehead. “Can you wait for a name? I wasn’t prepared for this.”

The child murmured something in his sleep. The torch beside the bed flickered twice in response.

She stared at the flame.

Then rose.

She stood barefoot, a loose cloth wrapped around her, swaddling the child again. The chamber door groaned softly as she opened it.

The corridor outside stretched ahead in pale wood and shadow — more ornate than she remembered. She stepped out into the hallway of the Living Quarters, where once the lesser gods slept and schemed. The walls still pulsed faintly with stored power, like the echo of thunder after the lightning is gone.

She passed room after room, each one empty.

No signs of life. No voices. No Merlin.

“Bastards,” she muttered, her voice sharp and low. “What have they done to me? Where are they?”

She pushed open another door, revealing dust-coated silks, a shattered mirror, a cold hearth.

Memories surfaced — Merlin’s warnings, Maliphant’s condescending jokes, the way they once looked at her: powerful, yes… but expendable.

She clenched her teeth, the child warm against her chest.

Her mind drifted to what she’d seen in those very halls not long ago — the way they laughed as a slave twisted into something else, his screams not even muffled. The gods called it improvement. Maliphant had given the creature a name before it lost its mind.

“Goblins,” she said aloud.

She moved forward, out of the Living Quarters, deeper into the heart of the lair.

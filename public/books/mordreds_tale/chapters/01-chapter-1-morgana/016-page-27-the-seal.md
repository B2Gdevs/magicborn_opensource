The further Morgana walked, the heavier the air became. Not with silence — but with stench. The Hall of Hollow Pilgrims reeked of rot and iron, a foul musk that caught in her throat. The gods had once filled this place with ceremony; now it had become a midden for the dead.

Bodies littered the approach to the gate. Some were nothing more than skeletons collapsed against the stone, jaws slack in eternal pleading. Others were newer, their flesh gray and half-consumed. She stepped past the twisted form of a beggar, still clutching an empty cup, his bones chewed through by something not human. Beside him, a creature’s carcass sprawled broken — its skull split where it had dashed itself against the wood.

The gate itself was splintered. Pale heartwood cracked in jagged lines, iron bands warped by force. Faint grooves scored the surface where claws and weapons had struck again and again in desperation. Men had tried to batter it down. Beasts had clawed it raw. All had failed. Their remains lay as mute testimony, scattered with coins and trinkets spilled from torn packs. Rings dulled to lead, swords rusted to red-brown stains.

Morgana did not touch them. She only looked. Rage simmered beneath her skin — at the Pantheon, at their arrogance, at their endless need to cage. Had they built this barrier to keep creatures out, or to keep her in?

The child shifted in her arms, but she kept her gaze fixed on the battered gate. “You’ve mocked me enough,” she whispered, voice low and fierce. “I am not yours to bind.”

The lycanthrope thrashed beneath her grip, strength enough to fell a dozen men — but not enough to shake her. Its growls echoed in the empty hall, a fading hymn to defiance. She pressed down, pinning its shoulders, then twisted. The crack resounded through the chamber, final and absolute.

Silence fell.

Morgana staggered back, the child still against her chest, his breathing soft, unaware. She looked at her arms, her skin unbroken, her strength renewed. But confusion gnawed at her more fiercely than the lycanthrope ever had. Without him, I am less. With him, I am more. Why?

She turned her gaze upward. At the far end of the hall loomed the sealed gate, pale heartwood bound in iron bands. She had never seen it in her years among the Pantheon. It radiated confinement, not grandeur, as though the hall itself had been built to funnel all who entered to that door.

Once, this place had been alive with ceremony. Columns draped in banners of conquest — Andovar’s sigil cut down, Cyrane’s crest hung in chains, Thestrel’s colors burned in mockery. She had stood among them, Merlin’s consort, eternal and feared. Now only dust remained, the walls stripped bare, silence where once kings had begged.

She adjusted the child in her arms. “One more obstacle,” she murmured. “Then we see what lies beyond.”

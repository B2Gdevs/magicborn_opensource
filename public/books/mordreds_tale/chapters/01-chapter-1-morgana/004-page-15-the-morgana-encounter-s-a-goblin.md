Morgana moved through the once-familiar corridors, barefoot, the soft creak of aged wood under her steps muffled only by the sound of her own breath. Mordred was bundled tightly in her arms, wrapped in the layered bedding she had clutched from her chamber. His tiny chest rose and fell against hers, soft breaths barely audible. The torchlight flickered wildly, even when there was no draft. Everything was... wrong. Once-smooth wooden walls now pulsed with a faint rhythm, as if the structure breathed in quiet agony. Shadows stretched longer than they should, curling around her like curious fingers. The echo of her steps came back too quickly. She glanced over her shoulder constantly, unsure whether she was being followed or simply watched by the lair itself. Level by level, she passed through what had once been divine opulence — now faded, withered. Pools of starlit water now dry, crystalline thrones covered in dust. She was reminded of bones. Then came the noise — a scratching echo from behind a cracked door ahead. Her pace slowed. From the gap slithered a goblin — malformed and frantic, its limbs thin like branches but tipped with claws. Its skin was papery, gray-green, its eyes feral. It sniffed once, then lunged. Morgana turned, shielding the baby with one arm and catching the goblin's wrist with the other. The goblin shrieked and plunged a rusted dagger toward her side — the tip met flesh… and bent like soft metal against stone. She stared, unblinking. The goblin’s eyes widened in terror. Then — without flourish — she shoved it. The creature was hurled backward with impossible force, smashing into the opposite wall. Wood splintered and cracked like thunder. The goblin's form sagged into a heap, its limbs at unnatural angles, the wall behind it cratered inward. Blood, thick and dark, oozed from under the broken body. Mordred whimpered. Immediately, the torch above them sputtered — not out of wind, but as if startled. Morgana's eyes narrowed. “Still there,” she whispered to herself — the strength the gods gave her, untouched by childbirth, undiminished by time. She glanced down at the baby. His eyes had opened. Not crying now… just watching the torchlight twist. She wrapped him closer to her chest, her arms firm, and moved on — up the carved stairs toward the upper levels.

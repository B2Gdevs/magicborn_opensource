# Page 17 - Chamber of Entwined Relics - Part 1

The stairway narrowed, and the air turned heavier — not with weight, but with silence. The next level opened into a domed vault that had been overtaken by creeping vines, both physical and architectural. Here, the lair no longer resembled a building, but something older — a space grown rather than constructed.

This was once the Chamber of Entwined Relics. Now it was something between a grave and a garden.

Roots twisted from the ceiling and walls, forming natural alcoves and branching fingers that cradled remnants of what had once been revered: a blade sealed in bark like amber, a shattered helm cradled in a nest of moss, a book half-swallowed by the wall, its pages calcified mid-turn. The ceiling bowed inward above her like the hollow inside a massive tree.

The remains of explorers littered the floor — many clearly ancient, their bones sun-bleached and half-covered in fibrous overgrowth. One skeleton had vines coiled through its ribcage, another was still fused to the haft of a spear embedded in the wall. All of them had come to steal something.

And all of them had stayed.

Chests — or what remained of them — were fused with the walls. Some were sealed with thick bark; others hung open, but empty. Gold coins had melted into the wood like sap. Enchanted rings were now dull, their bands stretched and warped as if the lair had chewed them.

Morgana moved slowly through the room. The air was damp, the scent earthy — but layered with rot beneath. Nothing here glowed. Nothing shimmered. Everything had once been magical. Now it was food for the lair.

A relic caught her eye — a staff of ivory and iron, speared through a knot in the wall. Its etchings were functional, not mystical — inventory markings, ceremonial design, but no longer active.

She reached toward it — then stopped.

Not out of fear. Out of instinct.

Something had brought others here. And something had left them behind.

Ahead, the corridor continued — narrower, darker. She walked on, the silence of this room folding closed behind her.

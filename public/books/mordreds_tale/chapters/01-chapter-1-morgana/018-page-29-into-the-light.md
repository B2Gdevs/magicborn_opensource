# Page 29 — Into the Light

The gate’s ruin yawned wide behind her, splintered wood and snapped iron scattered like bones. Morgana stepped out, boots pressing into scorched soil. The air was harsh, wind carrying the scent of smoke and char. Her eyes narrowed against the glare. After the suffocating weight of the lair, the daylight seemed too sharp, too empty.

Two guards stood at the perimeter of the lair. They had clearly not expected her. Spears lifted shakily, their eyes darting between her face and the swaddled child in her arms. One whispered a curse under his breath. The other barked, louder than his courage could support, “Stop where you are!”

Morgana didn’t. She walked forward with measured pace, unbothered by their weapons. Her gaze swept them as one might appraise tools left too long in the rain — armor dented, spears ill-kept, stances sloppy. These were not Pantheon-trained, not disciplined overseers. They were men of a world she did not recognize.

“Who commands you?” she asked, her tone steady, sharpened by expectation.

Neither answered at once. One swallowed, his grip tightening on his weapon. “You… you came through the gate. That’s not possible.”

Morgana tilted her head. “And yet I stand here. Answer me.”

The men exchanged uneasy glances, fear playing across their features. It was not just her presence that shook them — it was the child she carried, and the strength in her eyes.

For the first time since the hall, Morgana realized: to them, she might not be a prisoner walking free. She might be something far worse.

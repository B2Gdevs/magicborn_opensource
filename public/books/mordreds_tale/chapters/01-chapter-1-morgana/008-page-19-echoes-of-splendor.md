# Page 19 - Echoes of Splendor

The passage opened into a chamber Morgana knew too well. The Hall of Hollow Pilgrims. She had stood here once before immortality, when her kingdom was on the brink of conquest. She remembered the banners of Kairon, Velstrem, and Elderhaven hung high on these walls — kingdoms broken by the Pantheon’s will. Her own kingdom should have joined them. Instead, she had bent the knee, sworn herself to the gods, and lain in Merlin’s bed. Her people were spared, not by strength, but by her surrender.

The hall then had been a masterpiece of intimidation. Benches for emissaries stretched in perfect arcs before the raised throne of Maliphant the Necessary Evil , every sound magnified so a trembling envoy’s words echoed tenfold. Murals blazed with colors, recounting victories that grew taller with each retelling. Fountains ran with water so clear it shimmered like glass. When the Pantheon spoke from the dais, the room itself seemed to carry their voices.

Now the grandeur was gone. The benches were shattered, the murals faded to smears. Banners hung in tatters like molted skin. The throne was battered, parts of it lay broken, and a thick layer of dust had covered the once glorified seat of power. And at the far wall stood a gate — vast, solid, foreign. She had never seen it before. Its timbers were bound in dull iron, scarred with gouges like the claw marks of some trapped beast.

She gripped her child tighter. The hall she remembered had been meant to awe, to dominate. Now it felt like a tomb, and that gate was its final barrier.

# Page 28 — Breaking the Gate

Morgana halted before the seal. The wood loomed over her, pale heartwood bound in iron, scarred with deep grooves and splintered edges. Men had struck it with blades, beasts had hurled themselves against it, claws and steel alike had tried to cut a path through — all had failed. The evidence lay strewn across the stones at her feet.

A beggar’s skeleton slumped forward against the base, one bony hand still pressed to the gate as if in pleading. Beside him sprawled a corpse less ancient, the withered husk of an adventurer in rusted mail, his sword bent into the grain. A beast’s carcass lay nearby, its skull caved in where it had dashed itself in desperation. The smell of old rot clung thick in the air, mixed with iron and dust, sharp enough to sting her nose.

Coins glittered faintly in the grime. A pouch spilled long ago still lay open, gold dulled to brown. Trinkets rested where they had fallen: a dagger jeweled but rust-choked, a ring loose on a finger, a brooch warped from heat. The lair had become a graveyard of failure, strewn with scraps of treasure as useless as the bones around them. Morgana gave them no more than a glance. She did not need trinkets. She needed a way out.

Her fury sharpened as her eyes rose to the barrier itself. This was no divine gate, no artistry of triumph. It was a lock. A prison wall built to cage the desperate — to cage her.

The child stirred faintly against her chest, but her focus never wavered. She drew back her arm. Muscles coiled, rage honed sharp.

“Enough.”

Her fist slammed into the wood. The impact thundered through the chamber, iron shrieking, splinters flying like shards of bone. The gate cracked down its center, bands snapping, wood splitting apart.

Light pierced through. Daylight.

Morgana stepped forward.

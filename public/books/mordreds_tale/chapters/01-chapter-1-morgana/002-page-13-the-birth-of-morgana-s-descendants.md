# Page 13 - The birth of Morgana’s Descendants

The room was too quiet.

Morgana lay half-curled in her bedding, breath ragged, fingers locked in the folds of the blanket. Her skin was hot with sweat, pain still pulsing through her like echoes of thunder. Her eyes fluttered open again, trying to focus.

Then came the pressure. A tightening low in her abdomen — deeper than before.

She had no idea how long she’d been in labor. Time had fractured.

Another contraction seized her. This one broke through her exhaustion and pulled a raw cry from her throat. She braced herself with one hand and pushed — instinct, not knowledge — and something inside her shifted.

And then came the moment.

A wet, hot release. Her thighs trembled as her body yielded, and a sudden, impossible emptiness bloomed in her belly. She gasped, slumping back against the pillows.

A cry broke the silence.

Thin. Piercing. Too sharp for such a small thing.

She turned her head. A baby. Her baby.

The child lay in the blankets, slick with blood and birth, limbs weakly flailing, mouth open as another cry spilled out — clearer than before.

Her hands trembled as she reached for him. Her fingers were sticky with blood, but she didn’t care. She gathered the infant close. He was warm, surprisingly heavy, already curling against her like he knew her.

She stared.

Not in fear. Not in joy.

In disbelief.

This couldn’t be.

Pain radiated through her hips and spine. Another sharp ache followed — the afterbirth — and she shifted with a grimace, feeling the hot flow between her legs. The sheets were soaked. Her body was not finished.

Slowly, she leaned to the side, reaching for the bench where she kept spare linens. Her vision blurred as she moved, one hand pressed to her abdomen, the other clutching the baby, who now rested in the crook of her arm.

A folded wool scarf — she grabbed it with her teeth and pulled it close, wrapping it hastily around him. He whimpered but didn’t cry.

She sank back onto the bed with a groan, breath coming in slow, uneven gasps. The scent of blood mixed with the faint, stale perfume of old incense still clinging to the air.

And then it happened.

The torch flame nearest the bed pulled to the side. Not flickering — not dancing — but leaning, as if something unseen had passed too close.

Morgana stiffened.

A breathy whimper came from the baby. Another pulse of light followed. A soft crack in the wooden beam above — dry wood snapping faintly, like the room itself had shivered.

She looked down at him. His eyes were still closed. His tiny lips parted, releasing a second, softer sound.

And again, the air shifted.

Not colder. Not warmer. Just... strange.

She held him tighter.

No recognition. No understanding.

Just the gnawing sense that something had happened.

That he had happened.

And that nothing in her life had ever prepared her for this.

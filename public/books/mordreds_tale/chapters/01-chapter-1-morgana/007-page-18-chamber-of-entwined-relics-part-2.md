# Page 18 - Chamber of Entwined Relics Part 2

The corridor leading upward was rimmed with curving roots. No straight lines remained. It felt like walking through a throat.

To either side, relics jutted from the walls — unfinished, malformed, or decayed. A spear that had grown barbs. A ring that extended into thorned wire.  

The lair was not collecting.

It was producing.

Chests protruded from the walls like growths. One cracked open as she passed, revealing a pile of coins — still wet, still forming. They shimmered like freshly cast metal, but the smell was vegetal, almost fungal.

She paused near a relic embedded in the wall — a ceremonial staff, ivory and iron, etched with markings that looked bureaucratic. It hadn’t been placed here. It had emerged. The lower shaft still fused into the bark.

Her hand hovered over it.

Then withdrew.

There was no magic to speak of. No power. And yet… something about the room made her feel as if touching anything would be acknowledging it. That it would notice her in return.

She stepped forward. Her foot landed beside the remains of a traveler whose arm had grown moss from elbow to fingertip, bone visible beneath the green.

The deeper she moved, the more newly-formed the relics became. Half-shaped objects pulsed within the walls. You could almost believe the room was still building them — offering up illusions of wealth to lure more into its belly.

A final arch marked the end of the chamber, narrow and crooked.

As she passed beneath it, the air changed.

Behind her, the room held its breath.

And ahead… the corridor turned dark. And quiet. Until something, somewhere, scraped against the floor.

Not fast.

Not close.

But moving.

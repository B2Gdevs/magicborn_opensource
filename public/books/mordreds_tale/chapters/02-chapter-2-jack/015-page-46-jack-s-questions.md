# Page 46 — Jack’s Questions

Jack leaned forward, elbows on his knees, eyes never leaving the pendant. His tongue darted over his lips before he finally spoke. “So… what’s it do?”

The room quieted a little, though the storm outside filled the silence quick enough. The rain hammered the shutters like fists, and Ox cursed as he shoved them tighter again.

Jack pressed on, louder this time. “If Maliphant wore it all the time—if it was his—then it had to mean something. Why’d he keep it on him?”

Corin laughed, low and rough. “Boy, if we knew that, we’d be rich already. Maybe it lit the skies. Maybe it was nothing but a damn keepsake from his whoring days. Point is, Maliphant wouldn’t carry trash.”

Derrick nodded, eyes narrowing as though he could still see the god in his mind. “Every one of them had something. Trinkets, weapons, crowns, chains. And none of it was worthless. Couldn’t be. They bent the world with those things. You think Maliphant sat his throne with a bit of scrap on his chest? No. That pendant meant power. The kind we haven’t seen since the Fall.”

Selene snorted. “And you bought it without knowing a thing.” But her eyes lingered, just the same.

Jack’s pulse quickened. They didn’t know what it did, yet they all agreed it had to be important. And if it really was Maliphant’s—if gods needed relics as much as men did—then this was more than metal. It was a key. A promise.

Jack swallowed, his voice almost a whisper. “And now it’s yours.”

Corin smirked. “Ours, boy. Question is—maybe someday, it’ll be yours too.”

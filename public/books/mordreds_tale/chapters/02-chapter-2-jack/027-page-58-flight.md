# Page 58 - Flight

The streets of Tarro were rivers. Water rushed through the gutters, spilled over cobblestones, turned every low place into a temporary lake. Jack splashed through it all, head down, cloak pulled tight. The rain was so heavy he could barely see ten feet ahead, which was good—it meant no one could see him either.
His mind raced faster than his feet. He'd killed her. He'd actually killed her. The thought kept circling, refusing to settle into something real. His hands still tingled where they'd gripped her throat. He could still feel the moment she'd gone slack, the terrible finality of it.
No. Don't think about it. Think about what comes next.
He couldn't go back to the house. Never again. The body would be found—tomorrow, maybe, when the storm cleared and neighbors came to check on them. They'd see the collapsed roof, assume it had killed her. Unless they looked too closely. Unless they saw the marks on her throat.
Jack's stomach lurched. He stumbled to a stop beside a wall, bent double, and retched. Nothing came up but bile and the sour taste of terror.
Move. He had to keep moving.
He'd need shelter. Somewhere dry, somewhere away from the house, somewhere he could think. The Barrel was too obvious—if guards came looking, they'd check there first. His friends—but did he have friends? People who gambled with him, who laughed at his jokes, but would they hide a murderer?
A murderer. That's what he was now.
The barn. Old Corwen's barn on the north edge of town, the one everyone said was half-abandoned since the merchant had moved his business elsewhere. Jack had stolen hay from it before, back when they were desperate for kindling. If he remembered right, it had a loft. Dry. Hidden.
He pushed off the wall and ran.

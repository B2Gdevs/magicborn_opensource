# Page 44 — The Price Paid

Corin leaned back, arms folded across his chest, pendant still clutched tight. “Cost me more than any of you lot ever scraped together in one night of dice,” he said. “And I’d pay it again.”

Selene barked a laugh. “A fool and his coin. You’re glowing like a bridegroom over a lump of iron.”

Ox rumbled low in his chest. “Don’t matter the coin. You can feel it. Like heat coming off a fire, even if the flame’s gone.”

Jack swallowed, eyes flicking to the pendant. He didn’t feel heat. He felt weight, heavy as stone, pressing the air around them.

Derrick slapped the table, the sound sharp against the storm outside. “Mock him all you want, Selene. None of us has ever brought back something that mattered. We’ve sniffed through trinkets, broken rings, baubles that never lit up again. But this?” He jabbed a finger at Corin’s fist. “This is the crown jewel. The prize.”

“Prize for what?” Selene muttered, but she didn’t argue further.

Corin’s smile widened. “For all the waiting. For the nights we thought we’d never see something real again. For proving we’re not just rats chasing bones in the dark.”

The storm growled outside. The window rattled again, though Ox had latched it tight.

Jack leaned in, hardly breathing. It wasn’t just coin they were bragging about. It was victory — small, but theirs.

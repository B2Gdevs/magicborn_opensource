"—and the worst part," Morgause was saying, "is that you don't even care. You don't care that we're ruined. You don't care that I've given everything for you. You just—"

Jack's hands shot out.

They found her throat before thought caught up to action. His mother's eyes went wide, her words cutting off with a choked gasp. Her hands flew up, fingers scrabbling at his wrists, nails digging into skin.

"Stop," she gasped, barely a whisper. "Jack—what—"

But he wasn't listening. Fury had taken him, bright and hot and consuming. All the words she'd spoken, all the disappointment in her eyes, all the years of feeling small and worthless and trapped—it poured out of him in a strength he'd never let himself fully use.

"You're stronger than anyone we've seen."

His arms didn't shake. They held her like iron, like the treasures that would never break, like the power he'd been promised. Morgause's face began to turn colors, her mouth working soundlessly, her eyes pleading.

"No more," Jack said through clenched teeth. His voice sounded distant, like it belonged to someone else. "Never again."

She tried to speak, but only a wheeze came out. Her fingers weakened on his wrists, her struggles becoming more desperate, more frantic. The storm pounded on around them, rain pouring through the broken roof, washing over both of them in sheets.

"If magic wakes again, it'll be the man holding them that becomes a god."

Lightning flashed, illuminating her face in stark white. Terror. Confusion. Betrayal. And still, even now, disappointment. Like she'd known he would come to this. Like she'd always known he was capable of nothing better.

That look drove him harder. His grip tightened until his knuckles went white. Morgause's eyes rolled back, her body spasming, hands falling away from his wrists to claw uselessly at the air.

"Treasures that could build a kingdom from nothing."

The seconds stretched. Her movements slowed, became weaker, then stilled entirely. Her body went slack in his grip, deadweight that would have collapsed if he wasn't holding her up.

Jack held on longer than he needed to. Making sure. Making certain. When he finally released her, she crumpled among the broken timbers, her head striking the wet boards with a hollow sound that echoed through the ruined house.

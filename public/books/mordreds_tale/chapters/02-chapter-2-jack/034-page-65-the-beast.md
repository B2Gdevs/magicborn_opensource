# Page 65 — The Beast

The creature filled the opening, and Jack's mind struggled to process what he was seeing. It stood on two legs like a man but was wrong in every proportion—seven feet tall, shoulders too broad, arms hanging low and ending in hands tipped with claws the length of daggers. Its body was covered in patches of matted fur over pale, stretched skin. The head was the worst—caught somewhere between human and wolf, the jaw elongated and filled with fangs, but the eyes... the eyes held terrible intelligence.
This was no mindless animal. It was thinking. Planning.
The creature's nostrils flared, scenting the air. Its lips pulled back from yellowed fangs as it took a step into the chamber. Then another. The floor groaned under its weight.
Jack's hand found a piece of broken crate, the wood jagged and sharp. Not much of a weapon against something that size, but better than nothing. His fingers closed around it, knuckles white.
The beast's amber eyes locked onto him.
For a heartbeat, neither moved. Jack could hear his own blood pounding in his ears, could smell the creature's rank breath—old meat and decay.
Then it lunged.
Jack threw himself backward, swinging the broken wood. It connected with the creature's shoulder, splintering, drawing blood. The beast snarled—not in pain but in anger—and swiped at him with claws that tore through his shirt and scored burning lines across his ribs.
Jack screamed and stumbled back. His foot caught on debris, and he went down hard. The creature loomed over him, saliva dripping from its jaws onto his face.
The floor groaned again, louder this time. A warning.
The beast raised one massive clawed hand for the killing blow—
And the floor collapsed beneath them both.

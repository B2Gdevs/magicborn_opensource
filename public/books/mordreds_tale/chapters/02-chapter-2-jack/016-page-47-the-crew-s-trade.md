# Page 47 - The Crew’s Trade

Corin tucked the pendant back into his coat, grin sharp as a blade. "Thing is, boy, this ain't just about the pendant. This is what we do."

Jack frowned. "Do what?"

Derrick leaned back in his chair, boots thunking against the table. "We go in. Into the Lair. Tear through what's left, drag out anything worth a damn. Broken blades, goblets, bracelets, rings. Call 'em trinkets, call 'em treasures — doesn't matter. Folk'll pay just to say they've touched something once held by a god."

Derrick's eyes gleamed with something feverish. "You'd be surprised what fetches coin. A goblet that folk say poured endless water? Worth a fortune, even if it's bone dry now. A bracelet that once made crops leap from the soil overnight? Still sells, even if it's just a strip of metal now. A crown that bent men's knees with a whisper. A horn that called storms at sea. The hope alone is worth its weight in gold.  Hope in treasures that could build a kingdom from nothing."

Selene leaned forward, her smirk sharp, though her eyes betrayed the gleam of hunger. "Hope sells, Jack. Strongest coin there is. Doesn't matter that it's all gone — people remember what it used to be. They'll bleed themselves dry for the chance that maybe, just maybe, it'll wake again."

Jack's chest tightened. He pictured it: a goblet spilling forever, fields sprouting in minutes, treasures that shaped kingdoms. None of it worked now, but none of that mattered. Even the idea of magic still bent people's backs and emptied their purses.

Derrick's grin widened. "That's the trade, lad. Not dice, not cards. Treasure. The bones of gods."

Jack felt the words bite deep, like dice rattling in his chest. This was bigger than chance. This was destiny.

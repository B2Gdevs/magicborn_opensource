# Page 70 - Weeks in the Dark

Jack woke to dim light unchanged, time meaningless in the Lair's depths. His throat still burned but less than before. The claw marks across his ribs had scabbed over. He was healing.

The water skin was empty. His stomach cramped with hunger.

He'd need to leave the chamber. Find water. Find... something to eat.

The thought made him sick, but he forced himself up. Survival first. Everything else later.

He checked the barricade, then moved it aside enough to slip through the door. The corridor beyond was empty, silent. The creature hadn't returned.

Jack spent the next weeks learning the Living Quarters' secrets. He found water dripping from a crack in the wood three chambers down—slow but steady, enough to refill the skin daily. The taste was strange, metallic, but it didn't make him sick.

Food was harder. He found things growing in dark corners—fungi that glowed faintly, that made his stomach cramp but kept him alive. He tried not to think about what else he found in some chambers. Tried not to think about what he had to do when hunger became too much.

He explored, mapped the level in his mind, gathered relics. A bracelet that felt warm. A ring that hummed against his skin. A small mirror that showed his reflection strangely distorted. All dead, their magic gone, but Derrick's words kept him collecting them: Treasures that could build a kingdom.

And each night, he returned to her chamber. To Morgana—he'd found the name carved above the door, noticed it finally on the third day.

She never woke. Never moved beyond the steady rise and fall of her breathing. But lying beside her became routine. Comfort, even. The only beautiful thing in the darkness.

Jack would clean the dust that settled on her each day. Would lie close, sometimes touching her arm, her hair. Would think about Corin's face when he returned with power. Would imagine Gruff kneeling. Would picture himself as something other than worthless.

Would let his hands wander sometimes, feeling the curves beneath tattered finery, heat rising in his face even though she never responded, never knew.

I deserve this, he told himself each time. After everything, I deserve something.

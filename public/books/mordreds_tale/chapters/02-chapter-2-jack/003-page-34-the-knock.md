# Page 34 — The Knock

A soft rap on the door cut the room in two. Morgause paused, one hand on the latch of the tar pot, and set it down without clatter. She wiped her palms along her skirt, smoothing away dust that wasn’t there.

Jack didn’t look up at first. Knocks came and went in Taro—neighbors borrowing, sellers haggling, children daring each other. Another rap. The kind that expected to be answered.

Morgause opened the door. A man stood there in patched wool and clean boots, hat clutched to his chest. He was older than her, shoulders drawn in as if not to take up space, eyes focused somewhere near the threshold rather than her face.

“Evening later?” he asked, voice careful.

“Later,” she said. No flinch. No flourish. She stepped aside a finger’s width, then didn’t. Boundaries counted in rooms like this.

The man nodded, relief and something like gratitude passing over his features before he glanced past her and noticed Jack. His gaze skipped off the boy as if Jack were a sharp edge. He tipped the hat and stepped back from the door.

Morgause closed it gently and turned. “I’ll be out,” she said. “Back by nightfall.” She didn’t meet his eyes to explain. She never explained.

Jack watched the corner of her mouth, hunting for apology or shame, finding neither. Fine. He didn’t need either. Men in Taro did what they did; women did what they did. He’d be old enough to buy what he wanted soon. The transaction was the only honest part of the whole village.

“The roof,” she reminded him, lifting her cloak from the peg.

He pinched the knife blade between finger and thumb and tested its bite. “Sure.”

She tied the cloak at her throat, checked the list still lying on the table, and left it there. The latch clicked. Outside, the man’s footsteps matched hers for a dozen beats, then faded into the market’s hum.

Jack set the knife tip against the wood and pressed until it left a neat, satisfying groove.

# Page 36 — The Street of Shadows

Jack cut through Taro’s narrow lanes, boots scuffing stone worn by generations. People pressed past him — humans, dwarves, goblins — all moving with the weary rhythm of survival. A dwarf stooped under the weight of a timber beam, sweat streaking his copper-wired beard. Goblins squabbled at a fish cart, their rasping voices sharp as knives. Nobody stared at them. Why would they? Everyone in Taro bore some trace of the Pantheon’s cruelty. Some more obvious than others.

Jack glanced away. He’d grown up knowing why goblins had eyes too wide, why dwarves had backs like oxen. The Pantheon had molded them — twisted servants for their own amusement. Half the town had once belonged to them, and the rest descended from those who had. Newborns arrived without collars, without chains, but never without memory.

He flexed his fingers as the thought stirred another memory: himself at eight, cornered near the woodpile by a half-grown goblin. It had lunged, all teeth and ragged nails, but he’d planted his fist in its face and sent it sprawling. He’d stood over it, heart pounding, realizing he’d won with almost no effort. The thing had scrambled away, shrieking, but Jack remembered the shock in its eyes.

That memory was a flame he still fanned. Proof he wasn’t ordinary. Proof he could be more.

He turned onto the crooked lane where the Barrel waited, its sign swinging on rusted chains. The sound of dice carried into the street — sharp clicks, laughter, curses. The sound pulled at him like gravity.

Jack quickened his steps. He wasn’t coming for chores or for lists. He was coming for dice.

# Page 57 - What He’d Done

The storm was the only sound.

Jack stood over his mother's body, chest heaving, hands still curved into shapes that had held her life. Water ran down his face—rain, not tears. He stared at what he'd done, at the corpse that had been Morgause, and waited for something to break inside him.

Horror. Remorse. Grief.

Instead, he felt the path ahead clearing. No more voice calling him worthless. No more small life dragging him down. The Lair waited in the dark, and the treasures within would make him everything she'd said he'd never be.

But his hands were shaking now. His legs felt weak. He knelt in the water, not touching her, just looking. Her eyes were open, staring at nothing. He should close them. His hands wouldn't move.

"You were wrong," he whispered to the corpse. His voice cracked. "I'll be everything. You'll see."

But she wouldn't see. She'd never see anything again.

The reality of it crashed over him like a wave. He'd killed her. His mother. The woman who'd borne him, raised him, worked herself sick to keep them fed. And he'd killed her because she'd spoken the truth.

Jack lurched to his feet, stumbling backward. The pendant in his pocket felt like a stone, dragging him down. The dice felt like teeth. He had to move. Had to get out. If someone found him here—if the neighbors heard—

He grabbed his cloak from where it had fallen, wrapped it around himself with shaking hands. The storm was still raging outside, rain hammering the streets. Good. The storm would cover everything. Would wash away footprints, would make it all look like accident.

He stepped over his mother's body—don't think of her as mother, just a body, just an obstacle—and stumbled to the door. Paused there, hand on the frame, and looked back once.

Morgause lay among the ruins of their home, water pooling around her, the broken roof pouring rain onto her face. She looked small. Fragile. Nothing like the woman who'd screamed at him moments before.

Jack turned away and ran into the storm.

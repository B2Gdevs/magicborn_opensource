# Page 35 — The Weight

The door’s quiet shut left the room full of small sounds: the drip in the basin, the settle of ash in the hearth, a fly tapping against the window seam. Jack stood, stretched, and eyed the ladder. The yoke leaned where she’d left it, a patient burden waiting for a back.

He tried on responsibility in his head the way other boys tried on coats—imagined the climb, the tack of tar, the splinter jab that would lodge under a fingernail for days. He imagined the way she’d look at the fixed corner and say nothing, which was as close as she ever came to praise. It landed in him like a stone.

The Empty Barrel stirred in his thoughts: Derrick’s grin while the bones danced in his palm, Ox’s slow laugh, Selene’s coin flipping end over end, Corin spilling a handful of dead trinkets with a magician’s flourish. Rings that didn’t glow anymore. Amulets that didn’t hum. Stories that still bought a seat at the table even if the power was gone. That was a language he preferred—risk and luck and names said with a smirk.

He picked up the list. Read it once. Folded it and slid it under the tar pot, as if by hiding the paper he could hide the task.

The basin plinked. He moved it an inch, the laziest kind of solution, and told himself it counted. Outside, the lane called—market cries, the scrape of boots, the thick, tempting noise of people doing anything but asking him to be better.

Jack shouldered the door open and stepped into the light. The ladder, the yoke, the list—they stayed behind, arranged exactly as she’d left them.

The Empty Barrel wasn’t far. He could almost hear the dice already.

# Page 41 — The Back Room

The Barrel’s rear chamber was smaller, its air thicker. Smoke curled low, lanterns guttered against walls scarred by years of knife games and private dealings. The laughter from the front dulled to a muffled roar, leaving the table here a quiet stage.

Derrick dropped into a chair with casual authority, stretching his arms across the backrest. Selene perched beside him, coin dancing in her fingers, watching Jack like a hawk weighing prey. Ox closed the door with a thud and leaned against it, a living barricade.

Corin was already fussing with his pouch, eyes glittering with excitement. Trinkets spilled across the wood: cracked amulets, twisted rings, shards of crystal that once pulsed with power. He arranged them like holy relics, each set in its place with reverence.

Jack’s gaze caught on the dull gleam of metal and stone. Here, away from the shouting crowd, they felt heavier, more dangerous. He leaned closer, trying to drink in every line and rune.

Derrick nodded at him, grin still sharp. “Fifteen now, aren’t you? That means you’re a man in Taro. Not a boy patching roofs, not a brat chasing chores. A man makes choices. A man plays for more than coppers.”

Jack swallowed hard. The weight of their stares pressed him. Part of him wanted to laugh it off, pretend he wasn’t trembling with the need to belong. Another part wanted to grab the dice, grab the relics, and never let go.

Derrick gestured to Corin. “Show him the good one.”

Corin’s grin widened.

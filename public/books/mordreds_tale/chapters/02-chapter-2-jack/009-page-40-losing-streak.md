# Page 40 — Losing Streak

Jack’s coins dwindled fast. The dice spun from his fingers again and again, tumbling across the wood like traitors. Each throw was another copper sliding from his pile into Derrick’s or Selene’s waiting hands. He told himself the next toss would turn, that luck was bound to tilt back, but the bones refused him.

“Snake eyes,” Derrick announced with relish, sweeping in Jack’s last pair of coins. “Looks like the roof wins today, eh?”

Laughter rippled through the table. Jack forced a grin, though heat prickled up his neck. He’d pictured himself winning, earning cheers, maybe even slipping into Derrick’s seat for a throw. Instead he was broke. Morgause’s coins, her bread, her salt—they were gone.

Still, the thrill hadn’t faded. Losing stung, but it carried its own bite, its own belonging. He had sat at the table, rolled with the rest, felt the world hang on dice that answered no master. That was worth something.

“Enough for today,” Derrick said, clapping him on the shoulder. His grin wasn’t cruel. If anything, it was measuring. “Come on, Jack. We’ve got business in the back. Maybe it’s time you saw what we do when the dice cool.”

Jack straightened, surprise pricking through his embarrassment. A test? An invitation? Either way, he rose without hesitation.

The dice had stripped him, but maybe that was the point.

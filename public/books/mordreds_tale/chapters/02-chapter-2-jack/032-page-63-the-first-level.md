# Page 63 — The First Level

The corridor stretched ahead, doors lining both sides. Some hung open, revealing chambers thick with dust and debris. Others were sealed tight, their surfaces marked with deep scratches—something had tried to get in. Or out.

Jack kept to the middle of the corridor, away from the doorways. The dim glow from the walls was enough to navigate by, but shadows pooled in corners and doorways, hiding whatever might be waiting there.

His stomach cramped. The pendant shifted inside him, and Jack gasped, doubling over. It felt like it was expanding, pressing against his organs. He leaned against the wall until the pain passed, sweat beading on his forehead.

Keep moving. Don't stop.

He passed a chamber where corpses lay scattered—adventurers from years past, their bones picked clean, their rusted weapons useless beside them. Gold coins were scattered across the floor, worthless now. Jack didn't stop to gather them.

The corridor opened into a larger space—some kind of gallery. The walls were carved with reliefs depicting the Pantheon's glory, now seeming more like warnings than celebrations. And everywhere, more corpses. Dozens of them. All seeking treasure. All claimed by the Lair.

Jack's breath came faster. How many had died down here? How many had the Council sent to their deaths with the same empty promise they'd given him?

A sound echoed through the chamber—scraping. Rhythmic. Deliberate.

Scrape. Pause. Scrape.

Jack froze, his heart hammering. The sound was getting closer.

He looked around frantically. Three doorways led out of the gallery—one behind him, two ahead. The scraping was coming from behind.

Jack ran.

# Page 38 — Trinkets and Bones

The gang arrived with their usual noise — Derrick Varro first, sleeves rolled, grin too sharp. Selene followed, flipping her coin as if it was weightless, her gaze darting everywhere at once. Ox shouldered through the crowd like a cart in a narrow lane, and Corin trailed, clutching his pouch of relics.

Jack’s seat was already warm when Derrick spotted him. “Jack,” Derrick drawled. “Can’t keep away, can you?”

Jack smirked, but his pulse jumped. Derrick rolled the dice with a casual flick, and the whole table leaned in. They always did.

Corin spread his trinkets across the wood, one by one. A dull crystal. A cracked amulet. A ring whose band had warped like old tin. Nothing glowed. Nothing hummed. But Jack’s eyes locked on them anyway. He wanted to touch them, to feel if even a whisper of power remained. Maybe, just maybe, one would flare again in his hand.

“They’re good luck,” Corin said, grinning as he tapped the cloudy gem. “Not dead. Just… resting.”

Selene rolled her eyes, but her coin slowed. Even she wanted to believe.

Jack leaned closer, drinking in the sight. The relics were worthless, everyone knew. But in his mind, they gleamed. He imagined them alive again, power flowing through, making him untouchable. He wanted them almost as much as he wanted the dice.

# Page 66 — The Living Quarters

The world became a chaos of splintering wood and falling debris. Jack felt the sickening lurch of free fall, saw the creature's surprised roar as they both plunged through rotted flooring into darkness below.
He hit hard—another floor, solid this time—and the impact drove the air from his lungs. Pain exploded through his back and shoulder. Above him, the creature crashed through the wreckage, its massive body smashing aside broken planks and beams.
Jack rolled, gasping for breath that wouldn't come. The pendant in his stomach convulsed, and he retched blood onto pale blue wood that glowed with trapped moonlight.
They'd fallen into another level. The corridor stretched in both directions, wider than those above, the wood here different—smooth and ornate, carved with flowing patterns that seemed to pulse with faint light. Doors lined both sides, and through the few that hung open, Jack could see chambers of impossible luxury now thick with dust. Beds that had once floated lay crashed on intricately inlaid floors. Wardrobes of living wood hung open, revealing garments that still shimmered faintly.
The creature thrashed among the debris, finding its footing. It turned those terrible amber eyes on Jack—
Then stopped.
Its nostrils flared, scenting the air. Something changed in its posture. The predatory focus shifted to... wariness? Its ears flattened against its skull, and it took a step backward, away from Jack, away from the corridor.
Jack watched in confusion as the beast retreated toward the hole they'd fallen through. It looked at him once more, then began climbing back up through the wreckage, its claws finding purchase in the broken wood. Within moments, it had disappeared into the level above.
Jack lay there, trembling, not understanding. Why had it left? What about this place had driven it away?
He didn't have time to think about it. The pendant convulsed violently in his gut, and he vomited blood across the glowing floor. His stomach was grotesquely distended, the skin tight and discolored. He could see the pendant's outline pulsing beneath his flesh.
He was dying. He could feel it.
Jack forced himself to his hands and knees, then to his feet. His legs shook, barely holding him. One hand pressed against his swollen stomach, the other bracing against the wall.
He stumbled down the corridor, past open doors revealing empty chambers or ancient corpses. His vision swam. Each step was agony.
Then he saw it—a door different from the others. Ornate carvings around the frame, sealed tight. Something about it called to him, though he couldn't say why.
Jack threw his weight against it, and the door gave way.

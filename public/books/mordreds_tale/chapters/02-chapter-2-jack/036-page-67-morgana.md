The chamber was magnificent. Even through his pain-blurred vision, Jack could see it—a massive bed dominating the center, layered with embroidered blankets thick with dust. The ceiling carved with constellations that seemed to shift and move in the faint glow. Wardrobes of living wood stood open, revealing garments that shimmered with residual magic.

And in the bed—a woman slept.

Black hair spread across silk pillows like spilled ink. Tattered finery that spoke of nobility from another age. Her chest rising and falling in steady, peaceful breaths, as if she'd simply dozed off moments ago.

She was beautiful. Even in sleep, even covered in dust, there was something about her that made Jack's breath catch—an otherworldly quality that spoke of power and mystery.

Then the pendant convulsed in his gut and drove all other thoughts away.

Jack collapsed to his knees beside the bed, one hand pressed against his grotesquely swollen stomach. The pendant pulsed beneath his skin, visible through the stretched flesh, burning with cold that felt like it was freezing his organs solid.

"Help," he tried to say, reaching toward the sleeping woman. But only blood came out, and his hand fell short.

She didn't stir. Her breathing remained steady, undisturbed. Whatever sleep held her was deep and absolute.

Jack's body convulsed. He retched, blood spattering across the dusty floor. The pendant shifted, surging upward. He gagged, choking, fingers clawing at his throat.

He couldn't breathe. The pendant was lodged in his esophagus, too large, killing him.

Panic gave him desperate strength. Jack forced his fingers into his mouth, down his ravaged throat, gagging violently. The pendant shifted. He retched so hard his entire body spasmed—

And it came up.

The pendant tore from his throat in a torrent of blood and tissue, clattering across the wooden floor. Jack collapsed onto his side, gasping and choking, his throat raw and burning. But the cold fire in his gut was gone. The crushing weight was gone.

He lay there, just breathing. Each breath was agony, but he was alive.

When he could finally move, Jack crawled toward where the pendant had fallen. It lay in a pool of his blood, gleaming dully. He picked it up with trembling hands, wiping it clean on his torn shirt.

This was what he'd stolen. What he'd killed for. What they'd sent him here to die for.

Treasures that could build a kingdom from nothing.

Derrick's words echoed in his memory. Jack looked at the pendant, then at the sleeping woman.

A woman who slept in the Lair, untouched by time. A pendant of the old world. Power waiting to be claimed.

If magic wakes again, it'll be the man holding them that becomes a god.

Jack's fingers closed around the pendant, and despite the pain wracking his body, despite having nearly died extracting it, he felt something kindling in his chest.

Not just survival. Possibility.

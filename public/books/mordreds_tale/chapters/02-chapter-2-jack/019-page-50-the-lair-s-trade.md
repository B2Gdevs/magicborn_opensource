# Page 50 — The Lair’s Trade

Corin reached under the table and pulled out a roll of hide, stained and creased from years of use. He slapped it down and spread it wide. Lines scratched in charcoal ran crooked across its surface, broken hallways, circles for chambers, jagged marks where someone’s hand had pressed too hard.

Jack leaned forward, breath caught. It wasn’t much — half the marks made no sense — but he recognized it for what it was: a map. A map of the Lair.

Derrick tapped a scarred finger against it. “This is what we’ve scraped together. Every trip, we mark more. Sometimes we pull treasure. Sometimes we drag out nothing but broken bones. We’ve never gone deep — not yet. Place turns on itself. Gets darker the further you push. But there’s enough close to the surface to keep our purses full.”

Selene snorted. “Full enough to drink on, at least.”

Corin grinned. “A goblet with runes, dead but still worth silver. A set of rings once meant for some noble’s hand. A shard of a blade bigger than Ox. All scraps — all sold. And every time, the buyers hand over more than we thought they would. They don’t want the thing. They want the chance. The story.”

Jack traced a finger just shy of the map, not daring to touch. The lines were crude, but they called to him. Doorways. Chambers. A path waiting for someone bold enough to follow.

Derrick’s gaze was steady. “We risk the Lair, Jack. That’s our trade. Treasure for coin, coin for power. The world’s falling to pieces, but down there? Down there’s a kingdom waiting to be claimed.”

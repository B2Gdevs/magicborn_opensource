# Page 43 — The Old Man’s Story

Derrick finally spoke, voice louder than the storm. “The man who sold it—he was there. At the Fall. Said the whole place was crawling with beasts, people screaming, running. The gods? Frozen like statues. Maliphant sat on his throne, stiff as stone. Less than a man.”

Corin laughed harshly. “Old bastard told us he took one of Maliphant’s own swords, chopped his head clean off in a single swing. Pulled this pendant straight off his neck while the blood was still wet.”

Jack’s chest tightened. He could see it — monsters tearing down halls, men dying, and Maliphant, unmoving, toppled by a desperate stroke.

“The fighter cut his way out with that sword,” Derrick went on. “Kept this trinket close ever since. Fifteen years, holding on, hoping it’d wake up if magic came back. Said he wouldn’t let it go, not for any price.”

“But times change,” Corin added, shaking his head. “Man’s old now. Family’s starving. He came in this morning with hands shaking, voice cracking. Said it was useless to keep holding out hope.”

Selene scoffed. “So he sold it to you?”

“Aye. For a heavy price.” Corin puffed his chest. “Worth every coin. I asked about the sword, too, but it was gone. Sold years ago.”

The pendant lay between them, silent. Rain hammered the roof.

Jack couldn’t breathe right. Not for the storm, not for the laughter. For the weight of that dead stone and the story clinging to it.

# Page 51 — Invitation in the Storm

The rain battered the shutters, rattling them in their frames. The storm made the room feel small, the air close, as if the world outside had disappeared.

Derrick leaned across the table, his scarred face catching the lamplight. “You’re not a boy anymore, Jack. Fifteen makes you a man. And I’ve seen enough to know you’re not just any man.”

Jack shifted under the weight of the words. “Plenty of men in Tarro.”

Derrick’s mouth twitched, not quite a smile. “Plenty, aye. But not plenty who ever held Ox’s arm to the table. You remember that night. Loud with your boasting, a foolish bet over dice gone wrong. You should’ve been broken quick, but you weren’t. You held him. Long enough for us all to stop and look. Long enough to prove there’s more to you than swagger.”

Ox grunted but said nothing, his silence a kind of agreement.

Derrick’s gaze never wavered. “That caught my attention. And I’ve been watching since. You’re hungry, Jack. Dice don’t feed it. Chores won’t quench it. You want more, same as us.” He tapped a finger against the table, the sound sharp under the thunder. “The world’s worse now than it was under the Pantheon. No order. No power. People starve and bleed while scraps of treasure rot in the Lair. That can change. We’ll be the ones to change it.”

The pendant glinted as Derrick leaned closer. “I’m offering you a place with us. You’ve got the strength. You’ve got the hunger. The question is—have you got the will?”

The storm crashed above them, thunder shaking the rafters. Jack said nothing, but Derrick saw it in his eyes. The boy was already leaning in.

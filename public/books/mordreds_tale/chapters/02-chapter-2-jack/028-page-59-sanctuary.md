The barn loomed out of the rain like a ghost, its outline barely visible against the black sky. Jack circled it once, checking for lights, for signs of occupation. Nothing. The main doors were barred from outside, but there was a smaller side entrance that gave when he shoved it.

Inside, the world went quiet. The storm's roar became muted, distant, like it belonged to another realm. Jack stood in the darkness, dripping, letting his eyes adjust. Gradually shapes emerged from the black: stalls below, a ladder leading up to a loft, the musty smell of old hay and animal sweat.

He climbed the ladder on legs that barely supported him. The loft was half-full of hay bales, dry and sweet-smelling. Jack stumbled to the far corner, as far from the ladder as he could get, and collapsed.

For a long time he just lay there, staring at the dark rafters above, listening to the muted storm. His hands wouldn't stop shaking. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Morgause's face—terror, confusion, betrayal. Heard her voice: You're not a man, Jack.

"I am," he whispered to the darkness. "I will be."

He pulled the pendant from his pocket with numb fingers. Even in the dark, he could feel its weight, its reality. This was what mattered. Not her. Not the small life she'd wanted for him. This pendant, and the treasures like it, and the power they represented.

The dice came next. He held both in his palms, feeling their different weights. Chance and certainty. The old life and the new.

Jack closed his fists around them and pressed his hands against his chest. His heartbeat felt too fast, too loud. He waited for it to slow, for the shaking to stop, for sleep to claim him.

Eventually, from pure exhaustion, it did.

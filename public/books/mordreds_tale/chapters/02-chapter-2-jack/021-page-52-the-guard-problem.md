# Page 52 — The Guard Problem

The storm drummed against the windows so loud the room trembled. Rain streaked the shutters, wind howling like a beast outside. Derrick’s voice cut through the noise, low and determined.

“We can’t move yet.”

Jack stared. “Why not?”

Derrick’s eyes hardened. “The guards. They’ve been replaced. All new faces on the gate. The Council’s wise now—they’ve caught wind of our old tricks. Bribes used to open doors for us. That path’s closed.”

Corin spat. “We don’t know who we can trust. Who bends. Who breaks. We need to rebuild that web.”

Selene’s chair scraped. “We’ll test the waters, watch movement, ask questions. But we can’t push blindly.”

Jack felt the weight of that. They were planning, waiting, cautious—not like adventurers rushing blades into darkness.

Derrick leaned forward, scar stretching taut. “Stay ready, Jack. When we have the angle—when we see which guard flinches at a copper or a promise—you’ll be right there with us.”

Ox grunted, voice like gravel. “Till then, patience.”

The words tasted bitter in Jack’s mouth. He wanted to demand more, but Derrick’s gaze pinned him in place. This wasn’t a game of dice he could rush with bold throws. This was slower. Heavier.

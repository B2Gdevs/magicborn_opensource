# Page 71 — Magic Found

Six weeks, maybe more—time blurred in the unchanging glow. Jack returned to Morgana's chamber after hunting, the goblin meat wrapped in cloth and tied to his belt. Water could wait.

He barricaded the door as always, then collapsed onto the bed beside her. Exhaustion pulled at him immediately.

The pendant hung around his neck now, resting against his chest. He'd taken to wearing it after the first week, keeping it close. His body pressed against hers, his arm wrapping around her waist as he settled in, a habit formed over long nights.

The pendant grew warm against his skin.

Jack's eyes opened. He sat up, pulling the pendant away from his chest to look at it. In the dim light, it glowed faintly—just enough to see the metal catch the light differently.

His heart hammered. He looked at Morgana, still sleeping peacefully. Then at his hand, still resting on her bare skin.

Slowly, deliberately, Jack lifted his hand away. The pendant's faint glow remained for several heartbeats—then faded completely.

He touched her again. The pendant warmed, began to glow softly once more.

"What are you?" Jack whispered, staring at her sleeping face.

He experimented. Held contact for a slow count of thirty, then released. The glow lasted perhaps a minute before dying.

He tried again, this time keeping his hand on her skin for several minutes. When he released, the pendant stayed warm and faintly glowing for nearly five minutes before cooling.

Jack pulled out the bracelet he'd found two weeks ago. He slipped it on his wrist, then placed his hand on Morgana's body while holding the pendant with his other hand.

The bracelet grew warm. Not hot, just... alive. Like it had a pulse.

He released her and waited. The warmth in the bracelet lingered, then slowly faded over the next few minutes.

She was doing this. Somehow. Magic flowed through her even in sleep, and he could draw it out, store it temporarily in the dead relics.

Treasures that could build a kingdom from nothing.

Derrick's words made sense now. The treasures weren't dead. They just needed her to wake them, even if only briefly.

And he'd found her. Been sleeping with her for six weeks, touching her every night, and only now discovered what she truly was.

Jack looked at Morgana with new understanding. She wasn't just beautiful. She was the key to everything.

He lay back down, pressing himself against her, the pendant warm against his chest, his hand roaming over her skin. He held contact for a long time, feeling the pendant's warmth build slowly.

When he finally removed his hand, the glow remained—faint but steady. It would fade. The power was temporary, borrowed. But it was real.

Jack closed his eyes, his hand finding its way back to her. His mind spun with plans.

Corin. Gruff. The Council. All of them who'd thrown him here to die.

He'd found something they couldn't imagine. And he'd keep her. Learn everything about her, about the relics, about how to make the magic last.

Then he'd emerge. Not as a condemned criminal, but as something they'd have to fear.

I deserve this, he thought. All of it.

# Page 32 — The Leak

The roof ticked like a metronome, each drop hitting the basin with a hard plink. Jack sat at the table, whittling a stick into curls no one had asked for. The ladder leaned against the wall, a silent accusation. Nails, tar, a half-split shake—everything he needed to fix the problem waited within arm’s reach.

“Boards are soft,” Morgause said, eyeing the stain widening along the rafters. Her tone was even. “If the wind comes up, it’ll peel the corner clean.”

Jack dragged the knife down the grain and let a ribbon of wood fall. “Then I’ll nail it when the wind comes up.”

“Do it before.” She moved the basin an inch to catch a faster drip. “Not after.”

He shrugged. The knife rasped again. He knew the chores by heart—roof, woodpile, water, the market list. He could recite them in his sleep. He didn’t look at her because looking at her meant acknowledging expectations, and expectations had weight.

She crossed to the shelf, checked the food jar with a practiced glance, then set out a loaf to thaw. “You’ve got the shoulders for the work now. Fifteen means you stop pretending the house mends itself.”

“Fifteen means I pick my own hours,” he said.

“Fifteen means you’re a man,” she answered, “and men keep roofs over their heads.”

He kept whittling. The curls gathered like shavings of excuses. Outside, the lane murmured with morning—hammer strikes, market voices, a cart wheel squealing against a stubborn axle. All of it begged for someone else’s attention.

Morgause set the tar pot near the ladder and didn’t push it toward him. “Before midday,” she said, not louder, not sharper. Just final.

Jack spun the knife in his fingers and watched the drip find the basin on its own. The house could wait. Houses always did. People were the impatient ones.

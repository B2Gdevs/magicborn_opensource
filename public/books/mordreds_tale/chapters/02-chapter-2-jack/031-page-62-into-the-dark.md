# Page 62 — Into the Dark

The guards marched Jack from the Council Hall straight to the Lair's entrance. No holding cell. No time to prepare. Gruff's words echoed in his mind: You will depart immediately.

The barricades loomed before them—wooden beams, broken furniture, salvaged metal—all pulled aside just enough to reveal the gaping entrance. Ancient steps descended into the earth, their surface marred by dried blood turned rust-brown.

"Strip him," one of the guards ordered.

They took everything—his cloak, his belt, his boots. They left him in nothing but his shirt and trousers, bare feet on cold stone.

"No torch?" Jack asked, his voice tight.

"You get nothing." The lead guard's face was stone. "You want to survive down there, you figure it out yourself. You bring back something useful—artifacts, information, maps—maybe the Council reduces your sentence. You die..." He shrugged. "Then justice is served."

"Wait—"

They shoved him hard. Jack stumbled through the entrance, catching himself on the doorframe. Behind him, he heard the scrape of barricades being pulled back into place, sealing him in.

He stood at the top of the stairs, breathing hard. Then he noticed—he could see. Barely, but he could see.

The walls gave off a faint, sickly glow. Not bright, but enough to make out shapes. The wood itself was luminescent—pale blue heartwood that pulsed with trapped light, vines growing through it that glowed soft green. Everything looked organic, alive, as if the Lair itself was breathing.

Jack descended the stairs slowly, each step careful. The pendant in his stomach sat heavy and cold, but not yet painful. Not yet.

The stairs opened into a corridor. The wood here was smooth, carved with patterns that seemed to writhe in his peripheral vision. Dried blood marked the floor—old trails from creatures that had clawed their way up during the Fall.

Jack pressed forward, bare feet silent on the wooden floor. He had no weapon, no torch, no food, no water. Just himself and the stolen pendant burning cold in his gut.

From somewhere deep in the Lair, he heard scraping. Claws on wood.

He was alone.

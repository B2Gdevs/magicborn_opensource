# Page 64 — Deeper

Jack stumbled through the gallery, his breath coming in ragged gasps. Behind him, somewhere in the twisted corridors, something hunted. He'd heard it from the moment the guards had sealed the entrance—scraping. Rhythmic and deliberate. Claws on wood.
He didn't know what made the sound. Didn't want to know.
The gallery opened into a descending passage—stairs carved from the same pale, glowing wood, spiraling down into deeper shadow. The faint luminescence that lit the upper level dimmed here, the wood darker and more twisted.
Jack descended, one hand trailing along the wall for balance. Each step sent jolts of pain through his stomach where the pendant sat like a stone of ice. He could feel it shifting with his movement, unnatural and wrong.
The scraping grew louder behind him. Not rushing. Patient.
His heart hammered against his ribs. Whatever was following him didn't need to hurry. It knew he was trapped down here.
The stairs opened into a corridor narrower than the first level, the wood here gnarled and knotted. Doors lined one side, most hanging open to reveal chambers thick with dust and the remnants of lives abandoned fifteen years ago. Broken furniture. Scattered bones of those who'd come before him and failed.
The scraping echoed closer. Jack forced himself to move faster despite the cramping in his gut.
Ahead, a doorway gaped open. Jack ducked inside—some kind of storage chamber, shelves sagging under the weight of rotted crates. The floor felt soft beneath his feet, the wood warped and spongy with decay.
He pressed himself against the wall beside the door, trying to control his breathing. The pendant in his stomach pulsed with cold, and he had to bite his lip to keep from gasping at the sudden spike of pain.
The scraping stopped just outside the door.
Jack held himself perfectly still. Through the doorway, he could see a sliver of the corridor—empty, but he knew something was there. Could feel its presence like a weight pressing on his chest.
Silence stretched. His legs trembled with the effort of staying motionless. Sweat ran down his face despite the cold radiating from his gut.
Then it appeared in the doorway.

# Page 61 — Judgment

The Council Hall was built from stone blocks older than the Fall, its high windows letting in weak morning light that fell across the curved table where seven figures sat. Jack knelt in chains before them, the pendant burning in his stomach like a coal, while guards flanked him on either side.
Gruff sat at the center, the transformed dwarf's ancient eyes fixed on Jack with terrible weight. Around him sat the others—Marcus, Roran, Elena, Sara, Krix, and Thoren. These were the survivors who had built Tarro from the ruins of the Pantheon's fall.
"Bring forward the witness," Gruff said, his voice deep as grinding stone.
Corin stepped into the center of the chamber. His scarred face was grim, and he didn't look at Jack as he began. "Last night, after the storm started, I was heading back through Tinker's Row. The flooding was bad—water running in the streets ankle-deep. I was cutting through the alleys when I saw movement ahead."
The Council members leaned forward.
"A house with its roof collapsed—half the structure just... gone. Rain pouring straight through into the main room." Corin's jaw tightened. "Through the gap, I could see everything inside. A boy and a woman, shouting at each other over the storm."
Jack's chains rattled as his hands clenched.
"The woman was furious. Gesturing at the broken roof, at the water destroying everything. I couldn't hear the words over the storm, but her anger was clear." Corin paused, his voice going flat. "Then the boy moved. Fast. His hands went to her throat."
The silence in the chamber felt like a physical pressure.
"I saw her struggle. Saw her hands claw at his wrists, saw her fighting for air. He just kept holding on." Corin's eyes finally found Jack's. "It wasn't quick. She went from fighting to weakening to still. And he never let go."
"Why didn't you intervene?" Marcus asked.
"I was outside in a storm, watching through a collapsed roof twenty feet away," Corin said evenly. "By the time I could have gotten to the door, climbed through the wreckage—it was done. And I know this boy from the Barrel. He's stronger than he looks. Much stronger. I wasn't going to try to take him alone in the dark with no weapon."
"So you went to the authorities," Gruff stated.
"Straight to the Captain. Told him everything—the location, what I'd witnessed, described the boy." Corin gestured at Jack. "They sent guards immediately."
Roran nodded to Petran, the town's physician, who stepped forward.
"I examined the body this morning," Petran said, his voice clinical. "The woman—Morgause—died from manual strangulation. The bruising pattern indicates hands of considerable size and strength. The pressure was sustained for at least sixty to ninety seconds based on the tissue damage." He glanced at Jack. "This was deliberate, forceful, and prolonged. There's no possibility this was accidental."
Jack's stomach churned, the pendant heavy and burning inside him.
Sara leaned forward, her voice quiet but firm. "Morgause. I knew her well. We survived the Fall together." She looked at Jack with deep sadness. "She came to me often in these last months. Always worried about you."
Gruff let the silence stretch, then his ancient eyes fixed on Jack. "Jack. You have heard the testimony. You have heard the evidence. What say you?"
Jack's throat worked, raw and tight. "She—the roof had collapsed. Everything was destroyed. She was angry, blamed me for not fixing it, for wasting the money." His voice cracked. "She kept saying I was worthless. That I'd never be anything. That people only called me Jack because I wasn't worth jack shit. She kept saying it, and I just—I couldn't—"
"So you killed her," Gruff said flatly. "Because she spoke a truth you didn't want to hear."
"I didn't mean to!" The words burst out. "I was just angry—my hands moved—I didn't realize—"
"You held her for over a minute," Gruff cut him off. "You had time to feel her struggle. Time to see her face. Time to stop." He leaned forward. "You chose not to."
Jack had no answer. The truth sat like ash in his mouth.
The Council members spoke among themselves in low voices before Gruff raised his hand for silence.
Roran spoke. "The usual sentence is hanging. But we send expeditions into the Lair—volunteers and criminals both, seeking either redemption or answers about the Fall." He studied Jack. "The boy is strong. Morgause spoke of it often. That strength doesn't have to die on a rope."
"Trial by Descent," Marcus said.
"Yes. We lose people down there regularly. If he's going to die anyway, let him die serving Tarro's interests."
"He can seek redemption in the depths," Sara added quietly. "If he's capable of it."
Corin spoke from near the wall. "The boy's stronger than anyone I've seen. He's also reckless and selfish." A pause. "But that means he'll fight to survive. Use that. If he brings back something valuable, maybe he earns his life back. If not..." A shrug. "Justice either way."
Gruff let the debate continue briefly, then raised his hand. Silence fell.
"Jack. You have murdered Morgause. A woman this Council knew, who worked herself to exhaustion to provide for you." His voice was stone. "You have stolen her life and your own future."
The words fell heavy.
"But we are not the Pantheon. We do not deal only in absolute judgments. You will be sentenced to Trial by Descent."
The proclamation hung in the air.
"You will descend into the Lair with the next expedition. Every artifact you recover, every piece of information you gather about the Fall, every day you survive in service to Tarro—these will count toward your debt." Gruff's eyes bored into him. "If you prove valuable enough, if you survive long enough, you may one day earn your freedom. But until then, you belong to the Lair. You belong to the dark. And if the Pantheon's ruins claim you before your debt is paid..."
His expression didn't change. "Then perhaps that is justice enough."
Jack's throat was too tight to speak. The pendant burned in his stomach.
"You will depart immediately. You will be chained and guarded at all times until you descend. Any attempt to escape will result in immediate execution." Gruff's eyes held his. "Do you understand?"
Jack nodded.
"Take him away."
The guards dragged him toward the door. As he passed Corin, their eyes met briefly—something flickered there. Knowledge. Suspicion.
Then Jack was in the corridor, chains rattling, the pendant heavy in his gut, and the path to the Lair had finally opened.
Just not the way he'd ever imagined.

# Page 45 — Proving It Real

Selene squinted at the pendant, her lip curling. “How do you even know it’s real? Could’ve come off any corpse. For all you know, some merchant hammered it together and spun you a tale.”

Corin’s fist tightened around the chain. “Don’t talk rot.” His voice was sharp, almost defensive. “I stood in Maliphant’s hall more nights than I can count. Saw him sit that throne. Saw this hanging off his neck, right where his chestplate left room.”

Derrick leaned forward, eyes narrowing. “Same here. Guard duty. We watched him while he took his tribute. Whole lines of folk kneeling, trembling. You don’t forget the details when your life depends on them. This—” he jabbed a finger at the pendant—“is the same piece.”

Ox grunted his agreement, the sound like gravel rolling. “It’s real enough. Don’t need glow or sparks to prove it. I can still feel the weight when it’s in the room.”

Selene huffed, but her smirk faded. Her gaze lingered on the pendant longer than she meant to.

Jack’s breath quickened. If these men swore by it, if they knew because they’d served under Maliphant’s shadow, then there was no doubting it. The pendant wasn’t just metal. It was history, conquest, power—all fallen now, but still within reach.

The storm howled louder, wind battering the shutters. Ox rose with a curse, pushing them closed with a grunt. The room darkened, but the pendant still caught the lamplight like an ember refusing to die.

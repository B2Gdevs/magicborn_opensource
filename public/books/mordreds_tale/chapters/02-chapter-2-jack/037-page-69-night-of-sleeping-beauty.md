# Page 69 - Night of Sleeping Beauty

Jack slipped the pendant into a small pouch he'd found, fastening it to his belt. Then he turned his attention to the bed—and the woman sleeping in it.

She lay unchanged, peaceful, her chest rising and falling in steady rhythm. Jack moved closer, studying her in the dim light.

Dust covered her face, her hair, settled into the folds of her tattered finery. He found a cloth in one of the wardrobes and dampened it slightly with the precious water. Carefully, he began wiping the dust from her face.

The cloth came away grey. He rinsed it, tried again.

Her skin was pale beneath the dust, flawless. Her features delicate, almost too perfect. As he cleaned her face, Jack found himself unable to look away. She was beautiful in a way that made his chest tight, made heat rise in his face.

He wiped dust from her forehead, her cheeks, the curve of her jaw. Her lips were slightly parted with each breath. His hand trembled slightly as he cleaned the dust from her hair, revealing black strands that gleamed in the faint glow.

Jack's eyes traveled down—to the tattered finery she wore, the curve of her form beneath the fabric. His throat was raw, his stomach torn, his body screaming with pain—but he was still fifteen, still alive, and she was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.

His mother's voice echoed: You'll never be anything.

But he was something now. He'd survived what should have killed him. He'd stolen a treasure of the old world. He was in the Lair, in chambers where gods had lived.

He was a man now. Not the worthless boy his mother had cursed with that name. A man who'd taken what he wanted, who'd done what needed to be done.

And this woman... she was here, in this place where he'd been thrown to die. Another treasure waiting to be claimed.

Jack moved to the door, barricaded it with the heavy chest. Then he returned to the bed, his thoughts a tangle of pain and anger and desire. Corin's face flashed in his mind—watching through the broken roof, reporting him, destroying him. Gruff's ancient eyes passing judgment. The guards shoving him into darkness with nothing.

They'd given him nothing. Expected him to die with nothing.

But he'd found this. Found her.

Jack lay down on the bed beside her, close enough to feel the warmth of her body, to smell something faint and floral beneath the dust. His hand reached out, hovering over her arm, her shoulder.

He deserved something in this shitty life. After everything. After being called worthless, after killing the woman who'd borne him, after being condemned and thrown away.

He deserved this.

His fingers touched her arm, and she didn't wake.

Jack closed his eyes, exhaustion and pain dragging him toward sleep. Tomorrow he'd worry about water, about food, about survival. Tonight, he would rest beside something beautiful. Something that was his, in this place where he'd been sent to die.

His last thought before darkness claimed him was simple: I'm owed this. I'm owed everything.

He woke several times in the night, drifting between pain and something else—something primal and demanding. In his fevered state, the lines between dream and reality blurred. The woman beside him seemed to stir, her breathing changing rhythm.

Jack found himself drawn closer, his body responding despite his injuries. His hand, trembling no longer with weakness but with need, traced the curve of her waist. In the darkness, he imagined her eyes opening, imagined permission in their depths.

The night passed in fragments of sensation—skin against skin, whispered words that might have been spoken or merely thought. He took what he believed was offered, what he convinced himself he deserved.

When morning light filtered through the ancient windows, Jack lay spent beside her still form, uncertain how much had been dream and how much reality. All he knew was that something had changed between them—or perhaps only within him.

He touched her face again, brushed a strand of hair from her forehead. "Mine," he whispered, the word both possession and promise. Whatever happened next, whatever this place held for him, he had claimed something precious in the darkness.

A smile curved his lips as he drifted back to sleep. She hadn't resisted. In his mind, that was enough.

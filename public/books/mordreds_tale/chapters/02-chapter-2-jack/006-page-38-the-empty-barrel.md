# Page 38 — The Empty Barrel

The Empty Barrel breathed heat and smoke. The door swung wide on a roar of laughter, and Jack slipped in, the air immediately thick with ale, sweat, and lamp-oil haze. Every table groaned with elbows, cups, and scattered coins. But above all, it was the dice — clattering, rolling, biting against wood — that owned the room.

He kept to the wall, eyes on the back table where Derrick and his circle usually gathered. They hadn’t arrived yet. Good. That meant he had time.

Jack slid into a seat near the hearth, the coins he’d taken from Morgause burning in his palm. He didn’t count them; he knew the weight. Not much. Barely enough for a drink and a few throws. But it was his. She’d never notice the missing copper, not with the roof dripping and the list forgotten.

“Two in,” the dealer said, nodding at him. Jack pushed his coins forward. The dice landed in his hand — heavier than he expected, the bone worn smooth by a hundred other palms.

He rattled them once. The sound thrummed through his chest. When he threw, they skipped, tumbled, spun until the table swallowed them. For a heartbeat the room tilted toward him. All eyes followed the bones.

He lost the first throw. No one cared. He didn’t either. The thrill wasn’t in winning — not yet. It was in the toss, in the chance, in the moment the world waited on a pair of cubes.

Jack grinned. He wanted more.

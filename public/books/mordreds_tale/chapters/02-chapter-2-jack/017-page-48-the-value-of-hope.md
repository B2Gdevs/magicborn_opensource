# Page 48 — The Value of Hope


The storm hammered the roof, every gust rattling the shutters like a drumbeat. Derrick leaned in, voice rising to cut through the noise. “It’s not just about the power of one treasure, Jack. It’s about what you can build with them. You want to run a kingdom? Feed a people? Keep them safe? That takes more than swords.”

Corin nodded, jabbing a finger at the map spread across the table. “Say the goblet flowed again. Endless water—enough for crops, enough for soldiers. That alone could feed half the realm. And if the bracelets that sped the harvests woke up? You’d never see famine again. Every field could bloom in days.”

Selene leaned forward, her smirk gone now, eyes sharp. “And the little stuff—the lesser treasures—they’d buy trade. You could deal them out to merchants and lords, spread just enough hope to make them kneel to you. The rare ones you keep. The ones that matter—the goblets, the bracelets, the crowns—you use those to keep a country breathing.”

Derrick slammed a fist against the table, making the dice bowl jump. “That’s a kingdom, boy. Not built on taxes or tithes, but on treasures. You keep the strong ones for yourself. You trade the scraps, let others think they’ve got a piece of heaven. And when magic comes back—because it will—whoever holds the right treasures doesn’t just rule a town. He rules the world.”

Jack’s breath caught. Dice felt small now, petty. A single roll of bones couldn’t buy him what these men were talking about. This was bigger than chance. This was empire.

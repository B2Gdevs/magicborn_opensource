The silence stretched between them, filled only by the storm's voice. Jack's jaw worked, but no words came. He could still feel the weight of those lost coins, the way they'd clinked against the table at the Barrel, the way Corin had laughed when Jack had bet too much on a bad roll.

Morgause's expression shifted from fury to something worse—disappointment so deep it looked like grief. "You gambled it away. Didn't you?"

When he still didn't answer, she laughed. It was a broken sound, more sob than mirth. "Of course you did. That's what you do. That's all you ever do." She pressed her hands to her face, water and tears mixing together. "We have nothing now. No dry place to sleep. No way to cook. The rains won't stop for days, and by then everything will be ruined beyond saving."

She lowered her hands and looked at him with eyes that had given up hope. "You're not a man, Jack. You're a parasite. You live off my work, my sacrifice, and you give nothing in return."

The words struck like physical blows. Jack felt his chest tighten, his breath coming faster. In his mind, Derrick's voice echoed: Stay ready, Jack. When we have the angle, you'll be right there with us.

"I'm not—" he started.

"You're not what? Not worthless?" Morgause's voice rose again, sharp and cutting. "You know why people call you Jack? It's not because it's charming. It's because you're worth jack shit. Nothing. And I've watched you become that, day by day, choice by choice."

"A crown that bent men's knees, made them loyal no matter their will."

Jack's vision narrowed. The pendant in his pocket felt like it was pulling him down, or maybe pulling him toward something. His mother's face swam in the grey light, her mouth moving, more words pouring out—but he'd stopped hearing them. All he could hear was the storm and Derrick's voice and his own heartbeat pounding in his ears.

# Page 53 — The Send-Off

The storm outside beat against the walls, but the voices inside only grew heavier, dull with drink and repetition. Derrick and Corin circled the same talk, bribes and guards, while Selene’s tongue cut sharper and Ox stayed mostly silent. Dice rattled. Tankards clattered. Jack sat through it, the noise thick as smoke, until the words no longer mattered. They had already marked him, already made their intent clear.

At length, Derrick leaned back, his voice steady despite the haze. “That’s enough for tonight.”

The others groaned and muttered, but none challenged it. Corin grinned at Jack. “Don’t drown out there, boy.”

Selene smirked. “Not a boy anymore, remember? Let him swim.”

The laughter that followed was rough and sour, but it had a weight to it—a crooked kind of welcome. Derrick gave him a short nod, final as a seal.

Jack rose, pulling his cloak tight. He pushed open the door, and the rain swallowed him whole. The night was black and silver, gutters running fast, rooftops bleeding water. His boots splashed through flooded streets as he shoved his hands deep into his pockets.

The dice pressed against his palm, smooth and grounding. But in the other pocket, colder, heavier—metal.

The pendant.

# Page 49 — Bringing Jack In

Derrick’s gaze fixed on Jack, sharp as a blade. “You’re fifteen now. A man.” His words cut through the thunder outside, the table going quiet around him. “We’ve been watching you.”

Jack blinked, caught between pride and unease. “Watching me?”

Corin’s grin showed yellow teeth. “Don’t look so rattled. We saw what you did with Ox. Never seen anyone beat him at arm wrestling. Not once. Not even close.”

Ox grunted, crossing his arms, but didn’t argue. “Boy’s strong. Stronger than I was at his age. Maybe stronger than I am now.”

Selene leaned forward, her smirk gone. “Strength’s one thing. But you’re hungry too. We see it in your eyes, Jack. Dice aren’t enough for you. You want more. You want the world to bow.”

Derrick nodded, satisfied. “That’s what we all want. And let’s not pretend the world’s better off now. Folks starve in the streets. Towns vanish overnight. It’s worse now than it ever was under the Pantheon. At least back then, there was order.”

Corin slammed his fist on the table, making the pendant jump. “A cruel order, sure, but it kept people fed. Kept them safe. Now? Nothing but scraps. Fear and rot.”

Derrick’s voice lowered, steady as stone. “The Pantheon’s gone. But their treasures remain. If magic ever comes back, it won’t be the old gods that rule again. It’ll be us.”

The room was still. The storm raged. Jack’s heart pounded. He’d rolled dice all his life, chasing chance. But this—this felt like a wager that could change everything.

The storm hammered the broken roof with fists of water. Rain poured through the gaping wound where timbers had snapped under the weight, cascading in silver sheets that turned their home into a drowning box. Jack stood in the doorway, cloak dripping, and stared at the ruin.
Morgause stood in the center of it all, water streaming down her face and soaked dress, her thin frame trembling—not from cold, but fury. Behind her, their bedding floated in muddy pools. The chest that held their clothing gaped open, everything inside soaked through. Even the hearth had drowned, ashes spreading in grey trails across the floorboards.
"Where were you?" Her voice cut through the storm's roar. Not loud, but sharp enough to draw blood. "While our roof gave way, while everything we had washed into the mud—where were you, Jack?"
He opened his mouth, but she didn't wait for an answer.
"I was working." She gestured at the ruins around them, her hand shaking. "Twelve hours today. Twelve hours so we could eat, so we could keep this roof over our heads—and you?" Her eyes blazed in the grey stormlight. "You were drinking. Gambling. Throwing away coin we don't have while I worked myself sick."
Jack's fists clenched in his pockets. The dice pressed into one palm, the pendant cold against the other. "I wasn't—"
"Don't lie to me." Morgause stepped closer, heedless of the water that reached her ankles. "I know you, Jack. I've known you for fifteen years. You steal from me. You think I don't notice? The coins that go missing? The food that vanishes from our stores?" Her voice cracked. "You take and take and give nothing back, and now look—look at what your selfishness has cost us."
She swept her arm at the collapsed roof, at the broken beams that jutted like bones from a carcass. "You were supposed to fix this. Two weeks ago, I gave you the coin. Enough to patch the weak timbers, to replace the worst boards. Where did it go, Jack?"
He said nothing. The pendant felt like it was burning through his pocket.
"Where did it go?" she screamed.

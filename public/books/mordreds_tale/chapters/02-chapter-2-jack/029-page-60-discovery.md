Jack woke to voices.
For one blessed moment, wrapped in the warmth of dry hay, he didn't remember. Then it crashed back—his mother's face, her throat under his hands, the terrible stillness when she'd stopped moving—and he jerked upright.
Below, in the barn's lower level, boots scraped across wood. The grey light of dawn filtered through cracks in the walls, painting everything in shades of ash.
"—every barn, every shed," a man's voice drifted up. "Captain's orders after last night."
Guards. Jack's heart hammered against his ribs.
"Waste of time if you ask me," a second voice grumbled. "Storm's passed. Anyone hiding's long gone by now."
"We don't get paid to think. We get paid to search."
Jack pressed himself flat against the hay bales, barely breathing. The pendant sat heavy in his pocket, the dice lighter beside it. If they found him, if they searched him—
The pendant. They'd take it. Evidence of theft on top of murder. Jack's hand moved to his pocket, fingers closing around the cold metal. His mother's face flashed in his mind, disappointment even in death.
He had to keep it. It was all he had left of his future, of the promises Derrick had made, of the kingdom that could still be his if he survived this.
Jack pulled the pendant from his pocket. It was larger than a coin, the metal shaped into intricate patterns he couldn't read in the dim light. Too large to swallow comfortably. But if he didn't—
"Check the loft," one of the guards called out.
No time. Jack shoved the pendant into his mouth, forcing it past his teeth, feeling it scrape against the roof of his mouth. He gagged, throat convulsing, but he pushed it further back and swallowed hard. Once. Twice. The metal burned all the way down, too large, too sharp. His eyes watered. For a terrible moment he thought it would lodge in his throat, that he'd choke to death on stolen treasure in a barn loft.
Then it was down, sitting like a stone in his stomach.
The ladder creaked as someone started climbing.
Jack shoved the dice deep into the hay and stood, hands empty, facing the ladder as a guard's head emerged into the loft. The man was older, grey in his beard, tired eyes that widened when they found Jack.
"Well now." The guard pulled himself fully up, one hand resting on his sword hilt. "What have we here?"
Jack's mouth tasted like metal and bile. "I was just—"
"Just trespassing?" The guard's voice wasn't unkind, but it was firm. "In Old Corwen's barn? Without permission?"
"I needed shelter from the storm."
"Aye, I'm sure you did." The guard studied him. "Name, boy?"
Jack's throat worked. The pendant felt like it was burning through his stomach. "Jack."
"Jack." The guard's expression shifted slightly. "Jack who?"
Before Jack could answer, another voice called up from below. "Gareth! You find something?"
"Boy up here," the guard—Gareth—called back. "Sheltering from the storm, he says."
"Bring him down. Captain wants to see anyone we find."
Gareth gestured to the ladder. "Down you go, boy. Nice and slow."
Jack descended on legs that barely held him. Two more guards waited below, and between them, lamplight casting shadows across his scarred face, stood Corin.
The world tilted. Jack's grip on the ladder tightened until his knuckles went white.
Corin's usual grin was gone. His eyes were hard as flint. "That's him," he said quietly. "That's the boy I saw last night."

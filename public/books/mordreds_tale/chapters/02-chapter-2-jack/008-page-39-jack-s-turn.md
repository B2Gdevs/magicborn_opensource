# Page 39 — Jack’s Turn

“Your throw,” Derrick said, pushing the dice toward him.

Jack scooped them up, the weight of Morgause’s stolen coins already leaving his pocket. He rattled the bones, felt their clatter vibrate through his fingers, and cast them across the board. They tumbled, spun, froze. The table jeered. His throw was bad — again.

Heat rushed to his cheeks, but the shame only sharpened the thrill. Every man at the Barrel lost money. Every man watched the dice and prayed. Losing meant he belonged as much as winning.

Derrick laughed, slapping his shoulder. “Better luck next roll, Jack. You’ll catch the bones when they like you.”

Selene’s smirk cut sharper. Ox grunted his slow laugh. Corin whispered to his relics as if they were listening.

Jack forced a grin, gripping the dice too tight. He wanted them to like him. Wanted them to land right. Wanted to be more than the boy who left leaks in the roof.

When the bones hit the table, the whole Barrel tilted toward them. For one instant, Jack felt the world wait for him.

And he swore he would make it wait again.

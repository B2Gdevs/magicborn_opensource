# Page 33 — The List

She laid a folded scrap on the table where his knife had chewed the surface raw. “Water first,” she said. “Then the roof. If there’s time—flour, salt, and any root the market isn’t overcharging for.” Her handwriting was small and neat; she’d taught herself letters after the Fall, because nobody else would.

Jack didn’t touch the list. He leaned back, boots braced against a table leg, and stared at the ladder as if it might climb itself. “Woodpile still passable,” he said.

“For the morning,” she replied, tying a cloth around her hair. “Not the evening. The nights haven’t warmed enough.” She checked the hearth, knocked ash into a bucket, and fed it two thin sticks. Efficient. Unhesitating. It annoyed him how easily she found the next necessary thing.

He scratched the knife point along a knot in the table. “You always have another task.”

“That’s how roofs stop leaking,” she said. “Tasks and someone doing them.”

He didn’t answer. It was easier to be contrary than to admit she was right. Easier to imagine the Empty Barrel and its clatter, the slap of dice against wood, the way his name—Jack—carried a bite of recognition there. In the Barrel, no one handed him lists.

Morgause lifted the water yoke, then paused, weighing it in one hand. “You’ll do the well,” she decided, setting it down. “Your back’s stronger than mine.” She nudged the yoke closer to his boot, then picked up the tar pot herself and tested the lid. Preparation was a language she spoke without thinking.

He flicked his gaze at the yoke and away again. “I’ll get to it.”

“Before the sun tips,” she said. “The well line grows long after noon.”

He let the silence answer for him. She didn’t fill it. She never begged, never pleaded. She simply arranged the world so it could work—if he chose to lift a hand.

The list waited. The drip kept time.
